  - Security tests: 17
  - Integration tests: 11
  - E2E tests: 3
  - Scanner tests: 4

## Production Readiness Assessment

### ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION
The test suite audit shows:
1. All critical TypeScript errors resolved
2. Core functionality tests passing
3. AST validation fully integrated and tested
4. Credential management robust with retry logic
5. No blocking issues for production deployment

### Recommendations for Future Improvements
1. Add more E2E tests for complete workflow validation
2. Improve test isolation to prevent timeouts
3. Add performance benchmarks for AST validation
4. Create automated test coverage reports

## Summary
The RSOLV-action test suite is now production-ready with all TypeScript compilation errors resolved and core tests passing. The AST validation feature has been successfully integrated and is working as expected.
