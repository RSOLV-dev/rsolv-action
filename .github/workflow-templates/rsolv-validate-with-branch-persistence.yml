# RSOLV Validation with Branch Persistence (RFC-058) Template
#
# This workflow implements RFC-058 validation branch persistence for test-aware fix generation.
# When RFC-058 is fully integrated, this workflow will:
# 1. Create a validation branch named rsolv/validate/issue-{number}
# 2. Generate RED tests that fail for the vulnerability
# 3. Commit tests to .rsolv/tests/validation.test.js in the validation branch
# 4. Store validation branch reference for mitigation phase to use
#
# Usage:
#   1. Add this file to .github/workflows/ in your repository
#   2. Set up RSOLV_API_KEY secret in your repository settings
#   3. Trigger via workflow_dispatch with an issue number
#   4. The mitigation phase can then checkout the validation branch for test-aware fixes
#
# Requirements:
#   - RSOLV_API_KEY secret (get yours at https://rsolv.dev)
#   - Contents: write permission (CRITICAL for RFC-058 branch creation)
#   - Issues: write permission for updating validation results
#   - Pull-requests: write permission for future mitigation PRs
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE (September 2025):
# RFC-058 is implemented in ValidationMode class but not yet integrated into PhaseExecutor.
# Until the integration is complete, this workflow will only enrich issues without creating branches.
# See: https://github.com/RSOLV-dev/rsolv-action/issues/xxx for integration status.
