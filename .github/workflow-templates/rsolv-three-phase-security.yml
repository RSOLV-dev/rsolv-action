# RSOLV Three-Phase Security Workflow Template
#
# This workflow demonstrates the complete RSOLV security automation pipeline:
# 1. SCAN: Detect vulnerabilities and create GitHub issues (one per vulnerability type)
# 2. VALIDATE: Enrich issues with AST analysis and reduce false positives
#    - RFC-058: Creates validation branches with RED tests (when fully integrated)
# 3. MITIGATE: Generate targeted security fixes via AI and create focused PRs
#    - RFC-058: Uses tests from validation branch for test-aware fix generation
# 4. BILLING: Trigger credit consumption when PR is merged (RFC-091)
#
# Usage:
#   1. Add this file to .github/workflows/ in your repository
#   2. Set up RSOLV_API_KEY secret in your repository settings
#   3. Run workflow manually via Actions tab or let it trigger on pushes
#
# Requirements:
#   - RSOLV_API_KEY secret (get yours at https://rsolv.dev)
#   - Contents: write permission (REQUIRED for RFC-058 validation branch creation)
#   - Issues: write and Pull-requests: write permissions for GitHub Actions
#   - "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" enabled
#
# RFC-058 Status (September 2025):
#   - ValidationMode class implemented with branch persistence
#   - Integration with PhaseExecutor pending
#   - See rsolv-validate-with-branch-persistence.yml for RFC-058 specific workflow
#
# RFC-091 Status (December 2025):
#   - Billing mode implemented for credit consumption on PR merge
#   - Primary billing mechanism (Action-initiated, guaranteed execution)
#   - Idempotent: safe to run multiple times, won't double-bill

  # RFC-091: Billing Phase - Triggered on PR Merge
  # =====================================================
  # This job runs when a PR is merged to consume credits.
  # It's idempotent - safe to run multiple times without double-billing.
  #
  # The billing system has three layers of protection:
  # 1. Action billing (this job) - PRIMARY, guaranteed by GitHub Actions SLA
  # 2. Webhook billing - BACKUP, triggered by GitHub webhook
  # 3. Cleanup worker - SAFETY NET, catches any missed billing every 5 minutes
