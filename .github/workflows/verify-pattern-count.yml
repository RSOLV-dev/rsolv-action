          ## Pattern Counts

          - **API Patterns**: ~170 patterns (served via RSOLV-platform API)
          - **Fallback Patterns**: $TOTAL_PATTERNS patterns (in src/security/minimal-patterns.ts)

          ## About the Counts

          The 26 fallback patterns in minimal-patterns.ts are used for offline/local development only.
          Production deployments use the full ~170 pattern set from the RSOLV-platform API for comprehensive
          vulnerability detection across 8 languages.

          ## Verification

          This count is automatically verified by CI/CD on every commit.
