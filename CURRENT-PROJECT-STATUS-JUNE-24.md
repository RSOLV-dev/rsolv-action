# RSOLV Project Status - June 24, 2025

## Executive Summary

We've completed Phase 6C (Java/PHP validation) with critical findings about AST parsing limitations. Phase 6D (IaC/Terraform) is being postponed until after RFC-019 implementation to ensure proper IaC support architecture is in place first.

## Current Phase Status

### Completed Phases âœ…
- **Phase 1-4**: Core test generation framework
- **Phase 5**: Intelligent test framework integration (100% test coverage)
- **Phase 6A**: JavaScript/TypeScript validation
- **Phase 6B**: Ruby/Python validation 
- **Phase 6C**: Java/PHP validation (with critical findings)
- **Phase 6.5**: Fix validation integration (RFC-020) - implemented but needs re-validation

### In Progress ðŸ”„
- **Phase 6**: Real-world validation (3/5 sub-phases complete)
  - 6D postponed until after RFC-019
  - 6E pending (re-validate fix validation with Java/PHP)

### Pending ðŸ“‹
- **Phase 6E**: Re-validate fix validation with Java/PHP apps
- **Phase 7**: Write RFC-019 for Terraform/IaC security
- **Phase 6D**: IaC validation (after RFC-019)
- **Phase 8**: Production deployment

## Critical Findings from Phase 6C

1. **AST Parser Limitation**: The AST interpreter only supports JavaScript/TypeScript (Babel), causing 0% detection rate for Java/PHP/other languages
2. **Pattern Architecture Issue**: All Java patterns require AST enhancement, but without language-specific parsers, they fall back to regex-only detection
3. **API Pattern Override**: Local enhanced patterns work, but API patterns override them and are too narrow

## Solutions Implemented

1. âœ… Fixed AST interpreter fallback mechanism
2. âœ… Added comprehensive regex patterns for Java/PHP SQL injection
3. âœ… Created RFC-021 (Multi-Language AST Parsing Architecture)
4. âœ… Validated fix iteration works with Java/PHP through TDD tests
5. âœ… Created RFC-INDEX.md to track all RFCs

## Next Actions

### Option 1: Phase 6E (Re-validate Fix Validation)
- Test fix validation with real Java/PHP vulnerabilities
- Ensure iterative fixes work for non-JS languages
- Document language-specific adjustments

### Option 2: Phase 7 (RFC-019 for IaC)
- Draft comprehensive IaC security RFC
- Define Terraform vulnerability patterns
- Design policy-as-code test generation
- Plan integration architecture

## Outstanding Issues

1. **PHP Pattern API Mismatch** (Todo #133): API uses `:ast_rules` while expecting `rules`
2. **Multi-Language AST Support**: RFC-021 proposes solution but requires significant implementation
3. **API Pattern Updates**: Need to update RSOLV-api with comprehensive regex patterns

## Test Suite Status

- **Overall**: 477/505 tests passing (94.5% pass rate)
- **All non-skipped tests**: 100% passing
- **Skipped**: 28 tests (E2E and Linear adapter)

## Strategic Decision Point

We're at a crossroads where we can either:
1. Continue with Phase 6E to validate our fix iteration works with Java/PHP
2. Jump to Phase 7 to build proper IaC support before attempting IaC validation

Given that Phase 6D (IaC validation) depends on having proper IaC patterns and understanding, proceeding with RFC-019 first makes architectural sense.
