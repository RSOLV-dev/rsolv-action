# RSOLV Staging API Setup and Configuration

**Date**: 2025-08-26  
**Author**: Assistant  
**Status**: Configuration Complete with Issues Found

## Summary

Successfully retrieved staging API credentials from Kubernetes and tested the AST service. While the API is functional, there are critical issues preventing vulnerability detection in the tests.

## Staging Credentials

Retrieved from `rsolv-staging` namespace in Kubernetes:

```bash
# API Endpoints
RSOLV_API_URL=https://api.rsolv-staging.com

# API Keys (various privilege levels)
RSOLV_API_KEY=staging-master-key-123      # Master access
RSOLV_API_KEY=staging-internal-key-456    # Internal access  
RSOLV_API_KEY=staging-dogfood-key-101     # Dogfood testing
RSOLV_API_KEY=staging-demo-key-789        # Demo (limited)
```

## Current Issues

### 1. Pattern Loading Problems
- Only 4 patterns are returned regardless of API key privilege level
- Expected: 25+ patterns per language for full detection
- Patterns lack AST rules (`astRules: false`)

### 2. API Contract Mismatch
The AST endpoint response uses `findings` but the client expects `patterns`:

**Actual Response** (from staging):
```json
{
  "results": [{
    "status": "success",
    "path": "test.py",
    "language": "python",
    "astStats": { "parseTimeMs": 213 },
    "findings": []  // ← Wrong field name
  }]
}
```

**Expected Response** (per contract):
```json
{
  "results": [{
    "status": "success",
    "path": "test.py",
    "language": "python",
    "astStats": { "parseTimeMs": 213 },
    "patterns": []  // ← Correct field name per API contract
  }]
}
```

### 3. No Vulnerability Detection
Even with obvious SQL injection code, the AST service returns 0 vulnerabilities:
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + user_id  # Should detect SQL injection
```

## Root Causes

Based on the investigation:

1. **Pattern System Not Configured**: The staging environment appears to have minimal pattern data loaded
2. **API Key Privilege System**: Not properly differentiating between key tiers
3. **Field Name Mismatch**: Server returns `findings` but contract specifies `patterns`
4. **Pattern Enhancement Missing**: Patterns don't have AST rules attached

## Test Results

### Direct API Test
```bash
✅ AST endpoint responds: 200 OK
✅ Encryption/decryption works
❌ No vulnerabilities detected (0 patterns matched)
❌ Only 4 patterns loaded (expected 25+)
```

### Test Failures
- 11 AST service verification tests failing
- All expect vulnerability detection that isn't happening
- Tests blocked by MSW in test environment

## Recommendations

### Short Term (For Testing)
1. **Option A: Mock the AST Service** (Recommended)
   - Create comprehensive mocks that return expected patterns
   - Allows tests to pass without depending on staging
   - Most reliable for CI/CD

2. **Option B: Fix Staging Environment**
   - Load proper pattern data in staging database
   - Fix the `findings` → `patterns` field name
   - Ensure API keys have proper privileges

### Long Term
1. Fix the API contract mismatch in RSOLV-platform
2. Ensure staging has production-like pattern data
3. Document the minimum pattern requirements (25+ per language)
4. Add health checks for pattern availability

## Working Test Configuration

For tests that bypass MSW and hit real staging:

```javascript
// run-staging-test.mjs
const API_KEY = 'staging-master-key-123';
const API_URL = 'https://api.rsolv-staging.com';

// Direct fetch without test framework interference
const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/v1/ast/analyze`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': API_KEY,
    'X-Encryption-Key': encryptionKey.toString('base64')
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(request)
});
```

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate test success**: Implement comprehensive AST service mocks
2. **For staging validation**: Fix the staging environment issues
3. **For production readiness**: Ensure pattern data is properly loaded
