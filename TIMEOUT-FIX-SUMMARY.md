# GitHub Action Hanging Fix Summary

## Problem
The GitHub Action was hanging when processing multiple issues (7 issues found) due to excessive timeouts stacking up during sequential processing.

## Root Causes
1. **Claude Code timeout**: 5 minutes (300 seconds) per execution
2. **Sequential processing**: Each issue processed one at a time
3. **No overall workflow timeout**: Could run indefinitely
4. **No API request timeouts**: Network calls could hang

## Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Claude Code Timeout
**File**: `src/ai/adapters/claude-code.ts`
- Changed from 300000ms (5 minutes) to 30000ms (30 seconds)
- This prevents individual Claude Code executions from blocking too long

### 2. Added API Request Timeouts
**File**: `src/credentials/manager.ts`
- Credential exchange: 15 second timeout
- Usage reporting: 5 second timeout  
- Credential refresh: 10 second timeout
- Prevents hanging on unresponsive API calls

### 3. Reduced Default AI Provider Timeout
**File**: `src/config/index.ts`
- Changed from 60000ms to 30000ms (30 seconds)
- Affects all AI provider calls

### 4. Added Overall Workflow Timeout
**File**: `src/index.ts`
- Added 120 second (2 minute) timeout for entire workflow
- Uses Promise.race to ensure workflow completes or times out
- Provides clear error message if timeout occurs

### 5. Reduced Context Gathering Timeout
**File**: `src/ai/unified-processor.ts`
- Changed from 300000ms to 30000ms (30 seconds)
- Prevents long context gathering operations

## Expected Behavior After Fix (Updated for Multi-LLM Orchestration)
- Maximum runtime: 20 minutes (enforced by workflow timeout)
- Individual Claude Code operations: Max 15 minutes each (for complex multi-LLM workflows)
- Context gathering: Max 10 minutes for deep analysis
- API calls: Fail fast with timeouts (15s exchange, 5s usage, 10s refresh)
- Clear error messages if timeouts occur

## Rationale for Longer Timeouts
These generous timeouts support:
- Complex security vulnerability analysis requiring deep reasoning
- Multi-LLM orchestration where Claude Code coordinates multiple AI models
- Deep context gathering across large codebases
- Comprehensive solution generation with multiple approaches

## Testing Recommendations
1. Run with `DEBUG=true` to see detailed progress
2. Monitor which operations are taking the longest
3. Consider further optimization:
   - Parallel issue processing
   - Shorter timeouts for simpler operations
   - Circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures

## Build Status
✅ All changes compile successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors introduced
