# Working Context - RSOLV Three-Phase Architecture Session

## Quick Resume Instructions
1. Start new conversation with: "Continue debugging RSOLV three-phase architecture from WORKING-CONTEXT-2025-08-14.md"
2. Reference: `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action/docs/THREE-PHASE-DEBUGGING-SESSION-2025-08-14.md` for what was fixed
3. Reference: `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action/docs/TODO-CONTINUATION.md` for next steps

## CRITICAL: Testing Approach
**DO NOT CREATE ISSUES MANUALLY** - The three-phase architecture must be tested end-to-end:
1. **SCAN** workflow creates issues when vulnerabilities are detected
2. **VALIDATE** workflow enriches those issues with details
3. **MITIGATE** workflow fixes the validated vulnerabilities

Manual issue creation breaks the architecture and doesn't test the real flow.

## Current Status
- **Fixed**: v3.3.1-v3.3.6 released with SSJS injection detection
- **Working**: Validation detects eval() vulnerabilities correctly
- **Issue**: Validation data not being stored/retrieved between phases
- **Next Priority**: Fix PhaseDataClient to properly store validation results

## Key Files Modified
- `/src/modes/phase-executor/index.ts` - Added timeouts, logging
- `/src/validation/enricher.ts` - Fixed file detection patterns
- `/src/ai/git-based-processor.ts` - Fixed .rsolv directory handling

## Test Repository
- `nodegoat-vulnerability-demo` - NodeGoat has real vulnerabilities (eval injection in contributions.js)
- Workflows updated to v3.3.6:
  - `.github/workflows/rsolv-security-scan.yml` - SCAN phase (creates issues)
  - `.github/workflows/rsolv-validate.yml` - VALIDATE phase (enriches issues)
  - `.github/workflows/rsolv-fix-issues.yml` - MITIGATE phase (fixes issues)

## Environment Setup
```bash
cd ~/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action
export RSOLV_API_KEY=<your-key>
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Fix PhaseDataClient to store/retrieve validation data
2. Run SCAN workflow to create issues (NOT manual creation)
3. Run VALIDATE workflow to enrich issues
4. Run MITIGATE workflow to fix issues
5. Verify complete end-to-end flow works

## TDD Approach Used
- Write failing test → Fix code → Refactor
- All changes have test coverage
- Tests in: `/src/validation/__tests__/enricher.test.ts`
