As reference, check [GitLab's confidential issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html).\r\n\r\nThis is a most for organizations that handle coordinated disclosure and patching of security vulnerabilities on public open-source projects. It would allow discussions to go on between the early disclosure and the full disclosure dates. The issue could later be made public at the date of full disclosure.\r\n\r\nThis is the opposite of #639 but perhaps can be handled in the same work package as it will require similar constructs.",
