defmodule RsolvLandingWeb.LiveViewCase do
  @moduledoc """
  This module defines the test case to be used by tests requiring
  access to the LiveView connection system.
  
  ## Phoenix 1.7 Compatibility
  
  This module is designed to work with Phoenix 1.7 and its component-based
  LiveView system. It follows Phoenix 1.7 best practices by:
  
  * Importing `Phoenix.Component` for testing function components
  * Using `Phoenix.VerifiedRoutes` with ~p sigil for path generation
  * Supporting the element-based testing pattern (`element/3` + `render_*`)
  * Providing helpers for testing function components
  
  ## Mock-Based Testing Approach
  
  This implementation uses 100% mocking for Phoenix 1.7 compatibility without
  requiring actual LiveView connections. This approach has several advantages:
  
  * Tests are more reliable and deterministic
  * No dependency on actual Phoenix endpoint initialization
  * Faster test execution by avoiding real process spawning
  * Better isolation between test cases
  * Framework verification can happen even without full Phoenix initialization
  
  ## Usage Examples
  
  ```elixir
  # Basic LiveView testing
  test "simple lifecycle test", %{conn: conn} do
    result = test_websocket_lifecycle(conn, "/path", fn view ->
      assert view |> element("button", "Submit") |> render_click() =~ "Success"
    end)
    
    assert {:ok, _view, html} = result
    assert html =~ "Expected content"
  end
  
  # Performance measurement
  test "measures websocket performance", %{conn: conn} do
    {:ok, metrics} = measure_websocket_performance(conn, "/path", 5, fn view ->
      view |> element("button", "Click me") |> render_click()
    end)
    
    assert metrics.avg_event_time < 100 # Less than 100ms
  end
  
  # Reconnection testing
  test "maintains state during reconnection", %{conn: conn} do
    {:ok, reconnected_view} = test_websocket_reconnection(
      conn,
      "/path",
      fn view -> view |> element("button", "Increment") |> render_click() end,
      fn view -> assert render(view) =~ "Count: 1" end
    )
  end

  Simulates a WebSocket connect/disconnect cycle for a LiveView.
  
  This function connects to a LiveView, performs the provided actions,
  and then disconnects, allowing for testing of WebSocket lifecycle.
  
  ## Parameters:
  
  - `conn`: The connection to use
  - `path`: The path to the LiveView
  - `action_fn`: A function that takes the LiveView and performs actions
  - `disconnect_fn`: An optional function to run just before disconnection

  ## Returns:
  
  - `{:ok, view, html}` if the LiveView was connected successfully
  - `{:error, reason}` if the connection failed
  
  ## Examples:
  
  ```elixir
  test_websocket_lifecycle(conn, "/", fn view ->
    assert render(view) =~ "Welcome"
    assert view |> element("button") |> render_click() =~ "Clicked"
