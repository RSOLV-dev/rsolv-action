## Issues & Incidents

### Critical Issues
None reported

### Minor Issues
None reported

### Improvements Identified
- [ ] Monitor PHP pattern performance post-fix
- [ ] Track AST fallback usage for non-JS languages
- [ ] Measure fix validation iteration counts

## Test Quality Samples

### Recent Generated Tests
(To be populated as tests are generated)

## Action Items

### Immediate (Within 24 hours)
1. Monitor GitHub Actions for any test generation failures
2. Check error logs for unexpected exceptions
3. Validate test quality across different languages
4. Ensure no regression in existing functionality

### Short-term (Post 24-hour monitoring)
1. Analyze metrics and prepare summary report
2. Document any edge cases discovered
3. Plan optimizations based on performance data
4. Prepare for gradual customer rollout

## Monitoring Commands

### Check Recent Test Generation
```bash
# View recent GitHub Actions runs
gh run list --workflow=.github/workflows/security-check.yml --limit 10

# Check for test generation logs
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -i "test generation"
```

### Monitor Error Logs
```bash
# Check for errors in production logs
kubectl logs -n production -l app=rsolv-action --since=1h | grep -i error

# Check test generation specific errors
kubectl logs -n production -l app=rsolv-action --since=1h | grep -i "test.*generation.*error"
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -n production -l app=rsolv-action

# View metrics
kubectl get --raw /metrics | grep rsolv_test_generation
```

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues arise:

1. **Disable Test Generation**
   ```bash
   kubectl set env deployment/rsolv-action -n production ENABLE_TEST_GENERATION=false
   ```

2. **Full Rollback** (if needed)
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/rsolv-action -n production
   ```

## Contact & Escalation

- **Primary**: Test Generation Team
- **Escalation**: Platform Team
- **Critical Issues**: On-call Engineer

## Notes

- This is an internal deployment - no customer impact expected
- Test generation runs alongside existing fix generation
- Generated tests are marked as experimental in PRs
- Monitoring period ends: June 25, 2025 ~6:30 PM
