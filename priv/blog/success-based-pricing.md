The security tools industry has a dirty secret: most vulnerabilities found are never fixed. According to [Veracode's State of Software Security report](https://www.veracode.com/state-software-security-2024-report), only 35% of applications show sustained capacity to eliminate critical security debt.

Why? Because the entire business model is backwards.

## The Broken Incentive Structure

Traditional security tools operate on a simple model:
1. Pay for licenses (per seat or per scan)
2. Get vulnerability reports
3. Hope your team fixes them

Notice the disconnect? Vendors get paid whether you fix anything or not. In fact, finding more vulnerabilities often justifies higher prices, even if those vulnerabilities sit in your backlog forever.

This creates perverse incentives:
- Vendors optimize for finding problems, not solving them
- Teams get overwhelmed by alerts they can't action
- Security debt grows while everyone points fingers

## A Different Approach: Pay for Results

What if security tools only got paid when they actually made you more secure?

That's the principle behind RSOLV's success-based pricing. We don't charge for scans. We don't charge for reports.

**We only charge when you merge our fixes.**

## How Success-Based Billing Works

The model is simple:

1. **Free Scanning**: Run RSOLV on your codebase to identify vulnerabilities.

2. **Free Fix Generation**: We automatically generate pull requests for identified vulnerabilities. Review them, test them, modify them - all free.

3. **Pay on Success**: Only when you merge a fix do we charge a flat fee ($15 per merged PR). 

4. **Aligned Incentives**: We only succeed when you actually become more secure.

## Why This Changes Everything

### For Development Teams

No more security tool shelfware. You're not paying for potential value - you're paying for actual security improvements. Every dollar spent directly correlates to vulnerabilities eliminated.

Teams tell us this completely changes their relationship with security:
- "Finally, a security vendor that's on our side"
- "The ROI is obvious - we only pay for what works"
- "No budget waste on tools that just create more backlog"

### For Security Teams

Success-based pricing shifts the conversation from "How many vulnerabilities did we find?" to "How many did we fix?" It's outcome-focused security.

This aligns with modern DevSecOps practices where security is everyone's responsibility, not just a report to be filed.

### For Finance Teams

Traditional security tools are a capital expense with unclear ROI. Success-based pricing turns security into an operational expense with measurable outcomes.

CFOs love this because:
- Predictable costs based on actual fixes
- Clear value attribution
- No upfront license commitments
- Pay-as-you-grow model

## Common Questions

### "What if we don't merge many fixes?"

Then you don't pay much. If our fixes aren't good enough to merge, we need to improve them. That's on us, not you.

### "What prevents gaming the system?"

Our fixes are for real vulnerabilities. Merging them makes you more secure. The only way to "game" it would be to... fix your security issues. Which is the point.

### "How do you make money giving away free scans?"

We're betting on our fix quality. If we can automatically generate fixes good enough for production, teams will merge them. Volume and quality drive our revenue, not scanning licenses.

## The Broader Implications

Success-based pricing isn't just about billing. It represents a fundamental shift in how security tools should work:

1. **Quality over Quantity**: We're incentivized to find real, fixable vulnerabilities, not flood you with noise.

2. **Continuous Improvement**: Every rejected PR teaches us how to generate better fixes.

3. **Partner, Not Vendor**: We only succeed when you succeed. That makes us true partners in your security journey.

## The Goal

Our automated approach is designed to deliver:
- Significant reduction in time spent on security fixes
- 2-day resolution target vs. [industry average of 65 days for critical vulnerabilities](https://www.edgescan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-Vulnerability-Statistics-Report.pdf)
- Teams able to address substantially more vulnerabilities with existing resources

## The Future of Security Tools

We believe success-based pricing will become the standard for security tools. Why?

Because it solves the fundamental misalignment that has plagued the industry. When vendors only profit from making customers more secure, everyone wins.

No more shelfware. No more endless backlogs. No more paying for potential.

Just real security improvements, charged fairly.

## Try It Yourself

Skeptical? You should be. The security industry is full of bold claims and disappointing results.

That's why we invite you to try RSOLV with zero risk. Run scans, review our fixes, merge what works. Only pay for what you actually use.

Because the best way to prove success-based pricing works is to let you experience it yourself.
