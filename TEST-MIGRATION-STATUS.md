# Test Migration Status - 2025-08-24

## Summary
Migration from Vitest to Bun test runner is partially complete but facing significant challenges with module mocking.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- Replaced `vi.*` mock functions with Bun equivalents
- Created batch test runner for debugging
- Identified problematic test patterns

### üîß In Progress
- Module mocking strategy (using preload scripts)
- Fixing timeout issues with enhanced tests

### ‚ùå Blocking Issues
1. **Module mocking limitations**: `mock.module()` doesn't work reliably
2. **Test isolation**: Mocks from one test affect others
3. **Timeout issues**: Tests hang when trying to mock certain modules

## Research Findings

Based on research of similar projects (ElizaOS, others):

1. **Common Issues**:
   - GitHub issues #6236, #12062, #7823 confirm module mocking is problematic
   - ElizaOS (#5197) experiencing identical CI failures during migration
   - mock.restore() doesn't work as expected

2. **Solutions Being Used**:
   - Use `--preload` flag to set up mocks before tests
   - Run tests serially to avoid conflicts
   - Some teams keeping critical tests in Vitest
   - Increase timeouts for complex tests

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Hybrid Strategy (Recommended)
- Keep complex integration tests in Vitest
- Migrate simple unit tests to Bun
- Use preload script for common mocks
- Run test suites separately

### Option 2: Full Bun Migration
- Rewrite all mocks to work with Bun limitations
- Accept some test coverage loss temporarily
- Wait for Bun team to fix module mocking issues

### Option 3: Stay with Vitest
- Revert migration changes
- Keep using Vitest for consistency
- Revisit when Bun mocking is more mature

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today):
   - [ ] Test preload script approach
   - [ ] Fix critical test failures
   - [ ] Document which tests must stay in Vitest

2. **Short-term** (This Week):
   - [ ] Implement hybrid test runner
   - [ ] Update CI configuration
   - [ ] Create migration guide

3. **Long-term**:
   - [ ] Monitor Bun module mocking improvements
   - [ ] Gradually migrate more tests as Bun matures
   - [ ] Consider contributing fixes to Bun

## Decision Required

**Question for team**: Should we pursue the hybrid approach or revert to full Vitest?

The hybrid approach gives us:
- ‚úÖ Faster unit tests with Bun
- ‚úÖ Reliable integration tests with Vitest
- ‚úÖ Gradual migration path
- ‚ùå More complex test setup
- ‚ùå Two test runners to maintain
