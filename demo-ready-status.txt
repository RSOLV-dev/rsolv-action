⚠️  NOTE ON PR GENERATION
   The Fix workflow currently re-scans instead of
   generating PRs directly. This is a known issue
   but doesn't affect the demo flow since the key
   point is showing user control via labels.

   1. Trigger scan → Creates issues with 'rsolv:detected'
   2. Show user control → Only 'rsolv:automate' triggers fixes
   3. Educational value → Explain three-phase architecture

🎬 YOU ARE READY TO RECORD THE DEMO\!
