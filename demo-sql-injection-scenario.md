# RSOLV Demo: SQL Injection â†’ $4.45M Saved

## Demo Scenario Overview

**Company**: E-commerce platform processing $10M in daily transactions
**Vulnerability**: SQL injection in user authentication allowing account takeover
**Business Impact**: $4.45M potential loss (based on 2023 average breach costs)
**Fix Time**: 5 minutes with RSOLV vs 4 hours manual

## Step-by-Step Demo Script

### 1. Setup Demo Repository

Create a demo repository with vulnerable code:

```bash
# Create demo repo structure
mkdir -p demo-ecommerce/src/auth
cd demo-ecommerce
git init
```

Create vulnerable authentication file:

```javascript
// src/auth/login.js
const mysql = require('mysql');
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'ecommerce'
});

// VULNERABLE: Direct string concatenation allows SQL injection
function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    connection.query(query, (error, results) => {
      if (error) reject(error);
      resolve(results.length > 0 ? results[0] : null);
    });
  });
}

// Additional vulnerable endpoint
function getUserOrders(userId) {
  // VULNERABLE: No input validation
  const query = `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ${userId}`;
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    connection.query(query, (error, results) => {
      if (error) reject(error);
      resolve(results);
    });
  });
}

module.exports = { authenticateUser, getUserOrders };
```

### 2. Create GitHub Issue

Create issue in the demo repository:

```markdown
Title: Security audit needed for authentication system

Description:
Our security team has flagged potential vulnerabilities in our authentication system. We need to review and fix any SQL injection vulnerabilities in the login flow.

This is critical as we process over $10M in daily transactions and any breach could result in significant financial and reputational damage.

Priority: CRITICAL
Labels: security, high-priority
```

### 3. Run RSOLV Demo

```bash
cd /Users/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action
bun run demo-env
```

### 4. Demo Flow

#### Step 1: Get Issue
- Select "Get Issue (GitHub or Manual)"
- Enter the GitHub issue URL
- Show how RSOLV reads the issue context

#### Step 2: Analyze Issue
- RSOLV identifies this as a security-critical issue
- Complexity: HIGH
- Time estimate: 240 minutes (manual) vs 5 minutes (RSOLV)
- Shows related files to scan

#### Step 3: Generate Solution with Security Analysis
RSOLV will:
1. Detect 2 SQL injection vulnerabilities
2. Calculate business impact:
   - Financial: $4.45M (average data breach cost)
   - Reputation: Customer trust loss
   - Compliance: PCI-DSS violation risk
   - Operations: 72-hour incident response

#### Step 4: Show the Generated Fix

RSOLV creates a PR with:

```javascript
// src/auth/login.js
const mysql = require('mysql');
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'ecommerce'
});

// SECURE: Using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?';
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    connection.query(query, [username, password], (error, results) => {
      if (error) reject(error);
      resolve(results.length > 0 ? results[0] : null);
    });
  });
}

// SECURE: Input validation and parameterized queries
function getUserOrders(userId) {
  // Validate input
  if (!userId || isNaN(userId)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid user ID');
  }
  
  const query = 'SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?';
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    connection.query(query, [userId], (error, results) => {
      if (error) reject(error);
      resolve(results);
    });
  });
}

module.exports = { authenticateUser, getUserOrders };
```

### 5. Show PR Description with Three-Tier Explanations

The PR includes:

```markdown
## ðŸ”’ Security Fix: SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

### ðŸ“Š Executive Summary
**Risk Score: 95/100** - CRITICAL

This PR fixes 2 SQL injection vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to:
- Bypass authentication and access any user account
- Extract entire customer database including payment information
- Modify or delete transaction records

### ðŸ’° Business Impact Analysis

#### Financial Impact: $4.45M
- Direct costs: $2.1M (forensics, legal, remediation)
- Lost revenue: $1.2M (downtime, customer churn)
- Regulatory fines: $850K (PCI-DSS, GDPR violations)
- Legal settlements: $300K (customer lawsuits)

#### Reputation Impact: SEVERE
- 31% of customers would stop doing business after a breach
- Stock price average drop: 7.5% 
- Recovery time: 2+ years

#### Compliance Impact: CRITICAL
- PCI-DSS Level 1 violation
- GDPR Article 32 breach
- SOC 2 audit failure

### ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate**: Deploy this fix to production
2. **24 hours**: Audit all database queries across codebase
3. **1 week**: Implement prepared statement policy
4. **1 month**: Security training for all developers

### ðŸ“š Educational Explanations

<details>
<summary>Technical Details</summary>

#### Line-Level Explanations

**Line 12 (Before)**:
```javascript
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
```
- **Vulnerability**: Direct string concatenation allows SQL injection
- **Attack Example**: Username: `admin' OR '1'='1' --`
- **Result**: Bypasses password check, returns first user (usually admin)

**Line 12 (After)**:
```javascript
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?';
```
- **Fix**: Parameterized queries separate data from SQL logic
- **Protection**: Input treated as data, never as executable SQL

#### Concept Explanation: SQL Injection

SQL injection occurs when untrusted input is concatenated directly into SQL queries. Attackers can:
1. Bypass authentication
2. Extract sensitive data
3. Modify or delete records
4. Execute administrative operations

**Prevention Methods**:
- Parameterized queries (used here)
- Stored procedures
- Input validation
- Least privilege database accounts

</details>

### âœ… Changes Made
- Replaced string concatenation with parameterized queries
- Added input validation for numeric parameters
- Maintained exact same functionality with security

Time saved: 3 hours 55 minutes
Cost saved: $975 (developer time) + $4.45M (breach prevention)
```

### 6. Key Demo Points to Emphasize

1. **Speed**: 5 minutes vs 4 hours manual fix
2. **Accuracy**: Finds ALL vulnerabilities, not just obvious ones
3. **Education**: Teaches while fixing (three-tier explanations)
4. **ROI**: $4.45M saved for $15 fix cost = 296,666% ROI
5. **Compliance**: Automatic documentation for audits
