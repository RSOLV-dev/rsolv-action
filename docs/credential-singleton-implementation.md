# Credential Singleton Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented integration tests for the credential singleton pattern used in RSOLV-action. This ensures proper credential lifecycle management and prevents multiple concurrent credential exchanges.

## Implementation Details

### Test Coverage
Created comprehensive integration tests covering:
1. **Basic Operations**
   - Creating new instances
   - Reusing existing instances
   - Separate instances for different API keys

2. **Error Handling**
   - Retry logic on initialization failure
   - Proper error propagation after max retries
   - Cleanup on failure

3. **Concurrent Access**
   - Prevents multiple initializations for same API key
   - Properly handles concurrent getInstance calls

4. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Clear specific instances
   - Cleanup all instances
   - Proper credential storage and expiration

### Code Improvements
Fixed concurrent access issue in singleton pattern:
- Added `initPromises` map to track in-progress initializations
- Prevents duplicate credential exchanges when multiple requests arrive simultaneously
- Properly cleans up promises on completion or failure

## Test Results
All 10 tests passing:
- getInstance operations: 5 tests
- clearInstance operations: 2 tests  
- cleanup operations: 1 test
- credential management: 1 test
- concurrent access: 1 test

## TDD Approach
Followed red-green-refactor-review methodology:
1. **Red**: Wrote failing tests first
2. **Green**: Fixed singleton implementation to handle concurrency
3. **Refactor**: Cleaned up code and improved error handling
4. **Review**: Verified TypeScript types and updated documentation

## Benefits
1. **Resource Efficiency**: Prevents duplicate API calls for credential exchange
2. **Thread Safety**: Handles concurrent requests properly
3. **Error Resilience**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
4. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps
- Monitor production usage for any edge cases
- Consider adding metrics for credential reuse rate
- Implement credential pre-warming if needed
