**Total**: ~25,500 words of launch-ready content

## Key Findings from Research

### GitHub Marketplace Publishing Process
- **No review process**: Actions are published immediately via GitHub Releases
- **No separate submission form**: Use "Draft a release" → Check "Publish to Marketplace"
- **Prerequisites**: 2FA enabled, public repo, action.yml at root, no workflows in repo
- **Categories**: Select primary + optional secondary during release
- **Immediate availability**: Marketplace listing goes live instantly

### Documentation Structure
- Repository uses `docs/` root for most documentation
- Subdirectories for specific types: `adr/`, `archived/`, `claude-code/`, `troubleshooting/`, `rfcs/`
- Naming convention: UPPERCASE-KEBAB-CASE.md
- Launch materials belong at docs root, not in rfcs/

## Critical Path Items (Still Pending)

### Must Fix Before Publication
1. **docs.rsolv.dev DNS** - CRITICAL BLOCKER
   - Current status: DNS not configured (from Week 1 report)
   - Required: A record pointing to 10.5.200.0
   - Impact: Marketplace listing will have broken documentation link

2. **Logo Creation** - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Specification: 500x500px PNG, shield icon, blue color scheme
   - Location: Repository root or assets/ directory
   - Usage: Marketplace listing, README, social media

3. **Screenshots** - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Required: 3-5 high-quality images
   - Subjects:
     - Action in scan mode (detecting vulnerabilities)
     - RED test generation example
     - Automated PR with educational content
     - GitHub Actions workflow view
     - Multi-mode comparison (scan/validate/mitigate)

4. **Week 1 Changes Merge** - CRITICAL
   - Ensure action.yml and README updates are on main branch
   - Verify all changes from RFC-067 Week 1 are committed

## Launch Sequence (When Ready)

### Day 0: Pre-Launch Verification
1. Verify docs.rsolv.dev is accessible
2. Upload logo and screenshots to repository
3. Merge Week 1 changes to main branch
4. Test action end-to-end on sample repo

### Day 1: Publication (Hour 0-4)
1. **Draft GitHub Release** (hour 0)
   - Tag: v1.0.0
   - Check "Publish to GitHub Marketplace"
   - Select categories: Security (primary), Code Quality (secondary)
   - Add release notes from LAUNCH-BLOG-POST.md

2. **Publish Release** (hour 0)
   - Action immediately available on Marketplace
   - Verify listing at github.com/marketplace/actions/rsolv

3. **Execute Launch Plan** (hour 0-4)
   - Publish blog post
   - Email warm network (3 versions)
   - Social media blitz (Mastodon, Bluesky, LinkedIn)
   - Hacker News Show HN post
   - Community engagement (Reddit, Discord, GitHub Discussions)

### Day 1-7: Active Monitoring
- Respond to all comments/questions within 1 hour (day 1), 4 hours (week 1)
- Monitor installation metrics
- Fix critical bugs within 48 hours
- Collect feedback for roadmap

### Week 2-4: Iteration
- Weekly updates on social media
- Share customer success stories
- Publish follow-up content (case studies, technical deep-dives)
- Optimize based on user feedback

## Success Metrics (30/60/90 Days)

From RFC-067 and PRESS-KIT.md:

**30 Days**:
- 15-30 marketplace installs
- 3-6 trial signups
- 1-2 paying customers
- 4.5+ star rating

**60 Days**:
- 40-75 marketplace installs
- 8-15 trial signups
- 3-5 paying customers
- First case study published

**90 Days**:
- 100-150 marketplace installs
- 20-30 trial signups
- 8-12 paying customers
- Positive ROI

## Dependencies

**Blocks Week 3**:
- ❌ DNS configuration (docs.rsolv.dev)
- ❌ Logo creation
- ❌ Screenshot capture
- ❌ Week 1 changes merged to main

**Parallel Work (Can Proceed)**:
- ✅ RFC-065 Week 2 (platform work)
- ✅ RFC-066 Week 2 (other initiatives)
- ✅ RFC-068 Week 2 (if applicable)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Fix DNS** - Unblock documentation site (highest priority)
2. **Design Logo** - Commission or create 500x500px PNG
3. **Capture Screenshots** - Run action on demo repo, capture workflow outputs
4. **Merge Week 1** - Ensure main branch has all marketplace-ready changes

### Next Week (Week 3)
1. **Publish to Marketplace** - Execute release + launch plan
2. **Active Engagement** - Respond to community feedback within hours
3. **Monitor Metrics** - Track installs, trials, conversions
4. **Test with Real Repos** - NodeGoat, RailsGoat, production OSS project

### Future Considerations
1. **Verified Creator Badge** - Email partnerships@github.com after launch
2. **SEO Optimization** - Monitor "AI security GitHub Actions" search ranking
3. **Content Calendar** - Continue social media engagement (Mastodon daily, Bluesky 3x/week, LinkedIn weekly)
4. **Community Building** - GitHub Discussions, pattern contributions, user showcase

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| docs.rsolv.dev 404 | **CRITICAL** | Fix DNS before publication |
| No marketplace discovery | Medium | Multi-channel GTM strategy ready |
| Complex installation | Low | Clear 3-step guide in README |
| Credit burn concerns | Mitigated | Default mode set to 'scan' |
| Immediate publication (no review buffer) | Low | All content pre-prepared, ready to execute |
