   - Added fallback mechanisms for robustness

4. **Multiple AI Provider Support**
   - Implemented Ollama for local/self-hosted models
   - Created consistent API across different providers
   - Added flexible configuration for model selection
   - Implemented provider-specific optimizations

## Post-10-Day Plan Follow-up Items

These items have been identified for follow-up after the 10-day plan completion:

1. **Test Language Diversity**
   - Add test fixtures for languages beyond JavaScript/Node.js
   - Include compiled languages and statically typed options
   - Test language-specific context patterns

2. **Visual Documentation**
   - Create architecture diagrams using Mermaid.js
   - Add workflow visualizations in Markdown docs
   - Build visual comparison tools for solution quality

3. **Security Enhancement**
   - Conduct comprehensive security review
   - Document security boundaries and best practices
   - Implement secure credential handling improvements

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add benchmarks for large repositories
   - Implement parallel processing for context gathering
   - Optimize memory usage for scale

## Day 6 Focus Areas

For Day 6, we'll focus on:

1. Complete Phase 2 of Claude Code integration with UX improvements
2. Create minimal landing page
3. Prepare documentation for early access users
4. Set up early access program infrastructure

## Validation

The following demonstrations confirm completion of Day 5 deliverables:

1. **Demo Environment**
   - Run `bun run demo-env` to test functionality
   - Test issue analysis, solution generation, and PR creation
   - Verify feedback enhancement integration
   
2. **Claude Code Integration**
   - Select 'claude-code' as the provider in the demo
   - Observe the context-gathering visualization
   - Use the "Evaluate Claude Code Context Quality" option
   
3. **Ollama Integration**
   - Run `./run-ollama-test.sh` to test Ollama integration
   - Try different models with `OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b ./run-ollama-test.sh`
   - Select 'ollama' as the provider in the demo environment
   
4. **Test Coverage**
   - Run `bun test src/ai/__tests__/claude-code.test.ts` to verify adapter tests
   - Run `bun test src/ai/__tests__/claude-code-integration.test.ts` to verify integration
   - Run `run-e2e-test.sh` for end-to-end testing with real repository

## Conclusion

Day 5 deliverables are 100% complete, with significant progress already made on Day 6 items. The integration of both Claude Code and Ollama as AI providers gives users flexibility in choosing between cloud-based and self-hosted solutions. The comprehensive demo environment allows easy testing of all system components. The project is on track with the 10-day plan.
