# RSOLV Educational Content

RSOLV doesn't just fix vulnerabilities - it helps your team learn and prevent future issues. Every fix includes comprehensive educational content tailored to different audiences.

## Three-Tier Explanation System

### 1. Line-Level Explanations (For Developers)
Specific, actionable guidance for each vulnerability:

```markdown
**Line 45: SQL Injection Vulnerability**
Risk Level: HIGH

What's wrong:
```javascript
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
```

Why it's dangerous:
An attacker could input `1 OR 1=1` to access all users.

Secure fix:
```javascript
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [userId]);
```

Key takeaway: Always use parameterized queries to separate data from SQL code.
```

### 2. Concept-Level Explanations (For Tech Leads)
Deeper understanding of vulnerability patterns:

```markdown
## Understanding SQL Injection

SQL injection occurs when untrusted data is concatenated directly into SQL queries,
allowing attackers to modify the query's logic.

**Attack Scenarios:**
- Data theft: Access entire database tables
- Data manipulation: Modify or delete records
- Privilege escalation: Bypass authentication
- Server compromise: Execute system commands

**Prevention Methods:**
1. Parameterized queries (prepared statements)
2. Stored procedures with typed parameters
3. Input validation and sanitization
4. Least privilege database permissions
5. Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

**Related Concepts:**
- NoSQL injection
- LDAP injection
- Command injection
- Second-order SQL injection
```

### 3. Business-Level Explanations (For Management)
Executive summaries with business impact:

```markdown
## Executive Summary

**Risk Score: 85/100**

This pull request addresses critical security vulnerabilities that could lead to
complete database compromise.

**Business Impact:**
- üí∞ Financial: $2.5M average breach cost (IBM Security Report)
- üè¢ Reputation: 67% of customers lose trust after a breach
- üìä Operations: 23 days average downtime for SQL injection attacks
- üîí Data: Complete customer database exposure risk

**Compliance Impact:**
- GDPR: ‚Ç¨20M or 4% global revenue fine risk
- PCI-DSS: Loss of payment processing capability
- SOC2: Audit failure, loss of enterprise contracts
- HIPAA: $50K-$1.5M per violation

**Priority:** IMMEDIATE - Active exploits in the wild
**Timeline:** 2 hours to implement, test, and deploy
```

## Educational Features

### 1. Attack Demonstrations
Safe examples showing how vulnerabilities work:
```markdown
## How This Attack Works

Given this vulnerable code:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'
```

An attacker inputs:
- Username: `admin' --`
- Password: (anything)

Resulting query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'anything'
```

The `--` comments out the password check, granting access as admin!
```

### 2. Compliance Mapping
How fixes address specific requirements:
```markdown
