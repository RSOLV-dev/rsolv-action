# Bug Report: Test Generation Creates Inverted Tests

## Date: 2025-08-18

## Issue Summary
The test generation during the VALIDATE phase is creating tests with inverted logic - tests that PASS when vulnerabilities exist and FAIL when vulnerabilities are fixed. This is backwards from proper TDD methodology.

## Expected Behavior (Correct TDD)

### RED Test (Vulnerability Detection)
- Test should FAIL when vulnerability EXISTS (proving vulnerability is present)
- Test should PASS when vulnerability is FIXED (proving fix works)
- Example: Test that `eval()` throws error or doesn't execute injected code

### GREEN Test (Fix Validation)  
- Same test that failed (RED) should now PASS after fix
- This proves the fix successfully removes the vulnerability

### REFACTOR Test (Business Logic)
- Ensures business logic still works after fix
- Should PASS both before and after fix

## Current Behavior (Bug)

Our test generation appears to be creating tests that:
- PASS when vulnerability EXISTS
- FAIL when vulnerability is FIXED

This causes validation to fail even when fixes are correct, because the tests expect vulnerabilities to be present.

## Impact

1. **False Negatives**: Correct fixes are rejected as "failing validation"
2. **Blocks PR Creation**: Valid security fixes don't get merged
3. **Confusing Results**: Success looks like failure

## Root Cause

The test generation logic is creating tests that verify vulnerabilities exist, rather than tests that detect vulnerabilities by failing.

## Example

For an `eval()` vulnerability:

**Current (Wrong):**
```javascript
// Test passes if eval() executes code
test('eval executes user input', () => {
  const result = contributions.handleUpdate('2+2');
  expect(result).toBe(4); // PASSES with vulnerability
});
```

**Expected (Correct):**
```javascript
// Test fails if eval() executes code
test('should not execute arbitrary code', () => {
  const malicious = 'process.exit(1); 10';
  expect(() => contributions.handleUpdate(malicious))
    .not.toExecute(); // FAILS with vulnerability, PASSES when fixed
});
```

## Workaround

Currently using `DISABLE_FIX_VALIDATION=true` to skip validation entirely.

## Proper Fix

1. Rewrite test generation to create proper RED tests
2. Tests should fail to detect vulnerabilities
3. Tests should pass to validate fixes

## Discovery Context

Discovered while testing NodeGoat (deliberately vulnerable application) where all fixes were being rejected even though they correctly removed vulnerabilities.
