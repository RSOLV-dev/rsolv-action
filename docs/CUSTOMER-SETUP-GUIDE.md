# RSOLV Customer Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up RSOLV to automatically find and fix security vulnerabilities in your GitHub repositories.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository you want to protect
- Admin access to add secrets and workflows to your repository
- An RSOLV API key (get yours at https://rsolv.dev)

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Add Your RSOLV API Key

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `RSOLV_API_KEY`
5. Value: Your RSOLV API key (starts with `rsolv_`)
6. Click **Add secret**

### Step 2: Create the Security Scan Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/rsolv-security-scan.yml`:

```yaml
name: RSOLV Security Scan

on:
  # Run on every push to main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  # Run weekly on Mondays at 9 AM
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'
  # Allow manual runs
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Run RSOLV Security Scan
        uses: RSOLV-dev/rsolv-action@main
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.RSOLV_API_KEY }}
          scan_mode: scan
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          
      - name: Display scan results
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "=== Security Scan Complete ==="
          echo "Check the Issues tab for vulnerabilities found"
```

### Step 3: Create the Fix Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/rsolv-fix-issues.yml`:

```yaml
name: RSOLV Fix Issues

on:
  # Trigger when issues are created or labeled
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]
  # Allow manual runs for specific issues
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      issue_number:
        description: 'Specific issue number to process'
        required: false
        type: string

permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write  
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  fix-vulnerabilities:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Only run if issue has the rsolv:automate label
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'rsolv:automate') || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Run RSOLV Action
        uses: RSOLV-dev/rsolv-action@main
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.RSOLV_API_KEY }}
          issue_label: 'rsolv:automate'
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## How It Works

### 1. Finding Vulnerabilities
- RSOLV scans your codebase using 448+ security patterns
- Detects OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, CVEs, and framework-specific issues
- Groups similar vulnerabilities to avoid issue spam

### 2. Creating Issues
- Creates detailed GitHub issues for each vulnerability type
- Includes affected files, line numbers, and code snippets
- Adds severity labels (high, medium, low)
- Automatically applies `rsolv:automate` label for processing

### 3. Fixing Issues
- When issues are labeled with `rsolv:automate`, RSOLV generates fixes
- Creates pull requests with:
  - Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
  - The fix implementation
  - Educational content about why this fix works
  - Testing recommendations

## Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration

Create `.github/rsolv.yml` for custom settings:

```yaml
# Security analysis settings
security:
  enableAnalysis: true
  scanDependencies: true
  includeEducationalContent: true
  
# AI provider settings  
aiProvider:
  provider: anthropic  # or openai, ollama
  model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229
  temperature: 0.2
  
# Issue creation settings
issues:
  groupSimilar: true
  maxIssuesPerRun: 10
  labels:
    - rsolv:automate
    - security
```

### Advanced: Scan Specific Paths

```yaml
# Only scan certain directories
scanPaths:
  include:
    - src/
    - lib/
    - app/
  exclude:
    - test/
    - node_modules/
    - vendor/
```

### Advanced: Custom Fix Behavior

```yaml
# Fix generation settings
fixes:
  createDraftPR: false  # Create PRs as drafts
  branchPrefix: "rsolv/fix-"
  commitPrefix: "fix(security): "
  includeTests: true
  educational:
    enabled: true
    verbosity: detailed  # basic, detailed, or comprehensive
```

## API Key Tiers

Your API key determines the patterns available:

- **Free Tier**: 78 basic patterns
- **Pro Tier**: 172 patterns including framework-specific
- **Enterprise**: All 448+ patterns with custom rules

## Monitoring Usage

### View Scan Results
1. Check the **Actions** tab for workflow runs
2. Look for created issues in the **Issues** tab
3. Review pull requests in the **Pull requests** tab

### Usage Tracking
- View your usage at https://rsolv.dev/dashboard
- Set up webhooks for real-time notifications
- Export reports for compliance

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Scanning**
   - Run a manual scan first to understand your security posture
   - Review created issues before enabling automatic fixes

2. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Start with one repository
   - Fine-tune settings based on results
   - Expand to more repositories

3. **Review Process**
   - Always review generated PRs before merging
   - Use the educational content to train your team
   - Track metrics to show security improvements

## Troubleshooting

### No issues created after scan
- Check workflow logs for errors
- Verify API key is valid
- Ensure repository has vulnerabilities (try our demo patterns)

### Fix workflow not triggering
- Verify issue has `rsolv:automate` label
- Check workflow permissions
- Ensure API key has fix permissions

### API key errors
- Keys should start with `rsolv_`
- Check key hasn't expired
- Verify tier supports desired features

## Educational Content

RSOLV includes educational content with every fix:

1. **Vulnerability Explanation**: What the issue is and why it matters
2. **Attack Scenarios**: How this could be exploited
3. **Fix Rationale**: Why this specific fix works
4. **Best Practices**: How to prevent similar issues
5. **Compliance Mapping**: Related compliance requirements (SOC2, PCI-DSS, etc.)

   - 7 Hardcoded Secrets (HIGH)
   ```

2. **Issues Created**
   ```
   Issue #45: üîí SQL Injection vulnerabilities in 2 files

   ```

4. **Educational Content Included**
   Each PR includes explanations like:
   - "SQL injection occurs when user input is concatenated into queries..."
   - "This fix uses parameterized queries which separate data from code..."
   - "For SOC2 compliance, this addresses CC6.1 control requirements..."
