# RSOLV-action Test Suite Status

*Last Updated: 2025-08-25*

## Overall Status: âœ… Operational

The test suite has been successfully migrated from Bun to Vitest with significant improvements in type safety and test reliability.

## Test Coverage Summary

### Core Modules (100% Passing)
- **src/modes/**: All 129 tests passing
- **src/ai/adapters/**: All adapter tests passing
- **src/scanner/**: All scanner tests passing

### Known Issues
1. **Dynamic Import Limitation**: `processIssues` in phase-executor cannot be properly mocked (documented workaround in place)
2. **Memory Constraints**: Full test suite may hit memory limits when run all at once
3. **Some Integration Tests Skipped**: Server-side AST integration tests are skipped (require platform connection)

## Key Improvements Made

### Type Safety
- Replaced numerous `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Created comprehensive type definitions for phase data structures
- Improved IDE support and compile-time error detection

### Test Infrastructure
- Proper Vitest mock hoisting with `vi.hoisted()`
- GitHub API mocking using nock library
- Fixed test isolation issues between tests
- Proper environment variable handling

### Test Reliability
- Fixed phase data storage and retrieval
- Resolved mock pollution between tests
- Corrected test expectations to match actual implementation
- Added proper error handling in tests

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests in a specific module
npm test -- src/modes

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- src/modes/__tests__/integration-all-modes.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run a specific test by name
npm test -- -t "should execute all three phases"
```

## Maintenance Notes

1. **Always run TypeScript validation**: `npx tsc --noEmit` after changes
2. **Mock Management**: Use `vi.clearAllMocks()` in `beforeEach`
3. **Test Isolation**: Restore modified mocks after tests
4. **Environment Variables**: Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub API tests

## Future Improvements

1. Refactor dynamic imports to static imports for better testability
2. Continue gradual migration from remaining `any` types
3. Add more comprehensive integration tests
4. Improve memory usage for full test suite runs
