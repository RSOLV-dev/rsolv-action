## Email Body

**Version 1: Warm Network (Use for personal contacts)**

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick update: I just launched RSOLV on GitHub Marketplace.

**What it is**: An AI security engineer that validates vulnerabilities with executable tests before fixing them.

**Why it matters**: Security scanners have a false positive problem. RSOLV guarantees every finding is realâ€”if it can't write a failing test proving the vulnerability, it doesn't report it.

**How it works**:
1. SCAN: Detect vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
2. VALIDATE: Generate RED test proving it exists
3. MITIGATE: Create PR with fix that makes test GREEN

It's live now: [GitHub Marketplace link]

**I'd love your help:**
- Try it (10 free credits, no CC required)
- Share feedback (brutal honesty welcome)
- Forward to anyone who might find this useful

If you're building something with a security component, I'd be happy to jump on a call and discuss how RSOLV could help.

Thanks,
Dylan

P.S. Here's a 3-minute walkthrough: [screencast link]

Subject: Launching RSOLV: Test-First AI Security for GitHub Actions

Hi [First Name],

I'm excited to share that RSOLV is now live on GitHub Marketplace.

**The problem**: Security scanners have a 60-80% false positive rate. Teams waste hours reviewing non-existent issues, leading to alert fatigue and ignored findings.

**Our approach**: RSOLV is the first AI security tool that proves vulnerabilities before reporting them. It generates executable RED tests demonstrating real exploit scenarios, then creates fixes that make tests GREEN.

**Key benefits**:
- Zero false positives (no test = no report)
- Educational: Every PR includes security context
- Multi-language: JS, TS, Python, Ruby, Go, Java
- OWASP Top 10 coverage

**Quick stats**:
- 170+ security patterns
- AST-validated detection
- 3-step installation (< 5 minutes)

**Try it**: [Marketplace link]
- 10 free trial credits
- No credit card required
- Full documentation at docs.rsolv.dev

I'd appreciate any feedback from your team's experience. If RSOLV could help with your security workflows, I'm happy to schedule a demo.

Best,
Dylan

**Version 3: Developer Community (Use for GitHub connections, OSS contributors)**

```
Subject: Show HN: RSOLV - AI that validates vulnerabilities before fixing them

Hey [First Name],

Launching RSOLV today on GitHub Marketplace. Thought you might find it interesting given your work on [their project/expertise].

**TLDR**: AI security engineer that writes failing tests to prove vulnerabilities exist before proposing fixes.

**Why this matters**:
- Traditional scanners: "This might be vulnerable ðŸ¤·"
- RSOLV: "Here's a test proving it's exploitable âœ…"

**Example workflow**:
```yaml
- uses: RSOLV-dev/RSOLV-action@v1
  with:
    rsolvApiKey: ${{ secrets.RSOLV_API_KEY }}
    mode: scan  # or validate, mitigate
```

**Modes**:
- `scan`: Read-only detection
- `validate`: Scan + RED test generation
- `mitigate`: Full automation (scan â†’ test â†’ PR)

**Free tier**: 10 credits to try it out
**Docs**: docs.rsolv.dev
**Install**: [Marketplace link]

Would love your feedbackâ€”especially on false positives/negatives if you try it.

Cheers,
Dylan

P.S. Open to pattern contributions if you're interested in expanding coverage.

```
Subject: Re: RSOLV launch

[First Name],

Following up on my last email about RSOLV.

No pressure at allâ€”just wanted to share one more thing:

**Most common feedback so far**: "I didn't realize how many false positives my current scanner produces until RSOLV showed me what's actually exploitable."

If you're curious, here's a 90-second demo: [video link]

Thanks,
Dylan
