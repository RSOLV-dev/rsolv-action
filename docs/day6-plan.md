## Alignment with 10-Day Plan

Day 6 represents a pivot from core development to customer-facing functionality. Completing these deliverables will set us up for Days 7-10, which focus on:

- Day 7: Usage tracking and notifications
- Day 8: Customer outreach
- Day 9: Payment integration
- Day 10: Launch and first customer

## Success Criteria

Day 6 will be considered complete when:

1. Phase 2 of Claude Code integration is fully implemented and tested
2. Landing page is deployed and functional with early access signup
3. Documentation is comprehensive and ready for early users
4. Early access infrastructure is operational
5. All systems are prepared for onboarding initial test users

## Validation Plan

We will validate completion with:

1. Demo of enhanced Claude Code features
2. Review of deployed landing page
3. Walkthrough of documentation
4. Simulated early access user onboarding

## Risk Factors and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Landing page delays | Medium | Low | Use pre-built templates to accelerate development |
| Documentation gaps | High | Medium | Leverage automated documentation tools and templates |
| Early access infrastructure issues | High | Medium | Use established platforms for access management |
| Integration bugs | Medium | Low | Comprehensive testing with real-world scenarios |

## Resources

- Landing page templates: GitHub Pages or similar
- Documentation framework: Markdown + Mermaid.js
- Early access management: GitHub Organizations or custom solution
- Monitoring: Simple analytics integration

## Conclusion

Day 6 builds directly on the strong foundation established in Day 5. With Claude Code integration substantially complete, we now focus on preparing for early users and establishing the infrastructure for a successful launch. The plan addresses all critical components while allowing flexibility for adjustments as needed.
