    "requiredContext": [],
    "suggestedApproach": "Based on my analysis, this is a performance issue in the data processing pipeline.\n\nThe main bottleneck appears to be in the file processing function that's not properly streaming large files, leading to excessive memory usage.\n\nFiles that need modification:\n- `src/services/fileProcessor.js`\n- `src/utils/streamHandler.js`\n\nThis is a medium complexity issue that will require implementing proper stream processing instead of loading the entire file into memory. The fix should significantly reduce memory usage and improve processing speed.",
