# Skipped Tests Tracker

Date: 2025-06-23

This document tracks all tests that have been skipped or need attention during the test suite cleanup effort.

## Skipped Tests

### 1. Claude Code parseSolution Tests
**File**: `src/ai/__tests__/claude-code.test.ts`
**Tests**:
- `parseSolution should handle direct JSON in text content`
- `parseSolution should handle JSON in code blocks`
- `parseSolution should fall back to default solution if parsing fails`

**Reason**: The `parseSolution` method no longer exists in the current Claude Code adapter implementation. The adapter now handles solution parsing internally through the SDK.

**Action**: These tests should be removed entirely as they test non-existent functionality.

### 2. E2E Tests
**Files**: 
- `tests/e2e/full-demo-flow.test.ts` (7 tests)
- `tests/e2e/example-e2e.test.ts` (6 tests)

**Reason**: These tests require real credentials (GITHUB_TOKEN, RSOLV_API_KEY, RSOLV_API_URL) and connect to external services.

**Action**: These tests should remain skipped in local development but could be enabled in CI/CD with proper secrets configuration.

### 3. Linear/Jira Adapter Tests
**File**: `tests/platforms/jira/jira-adapter.test.ts` (1 test)

**Reason**: User explicitly requested to skip Linear adapter tests ("We can continue to skip Linear adapter tests for now").

**Action**: Keep skipped until Linear/Jira integration is a priority.

### 4. Claude Code Live Tests
**Various Files**: Tests that check for `RUN_LIVE_TESTS` environment variable

**Reason**: These tests make real API calls and are meant for manual testing only.

**Action**: Keep skipped in automated test runs.

## Tests with Mock Pollution Issues

### Integration Tests (41 tests total)
**Files**:
- `tests/integration/ai-integration.test.ts` (3 tests)
- `tests/integration/github-integration.test.ts` (4 tests)
- `tests/integration/unified-processor.test.ts` (6 tests)
- `tests/integration/config.test.ts` (6 tests)
- `tests/integration/container.test.ts` (5 tests)
- `tests/integration/error-sanitization.test.ts` (6 tests)
- `tests/integration/vended-credentials.test.ts` (11 tests)

**Issue**: Tests pass individually but fail when run together due to Bun's mock pollution (mocks persist across test files).

**Current Workaround**: Using `run-tests-isolated.sh` to run tests in isolation.

**Long-term Solutions**:
1. Wait for Bun to fix mock pollution (issues #6040, #5391)
2. Migrate to Jest/Vitest for integration tests
3. Continue using isolation runner

## Tests Needing Updates

### Client Integration Tests
**File**: `src/ai/__tests__/client-integration.test.ts`

**Issues**:
- Using non-existent `mockResponseOnce` method
- Incorrect mock property access (`mock.mock.calls` vs `mock.calls`)

**Status**: Currently being fixed

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Skipped Tests**: 28
  - E2E tests: 13
  - Claude Code obsolete tests: 3
  - Linear/Jira tests: 1
  - Various skip conditions: 11

- **Tests Fixed**: 8 test files
  - `src/ai/adapters/__tests__/claude-code-integration.test.ts` - Fixed prompt assertions
  - `src/ai/adapters/__tests__/claude-code-timeout.test.ts` - Fixed isAvailable() and error messages
  - `src/ai/__tests__/claude-code.test.ts` - Skipped obsolete parseSolution tests
  - `src/ai/__tests__/client-integration.test.ts` - Fixed mock methods and header checks
  - `src/ai/__tests__/client-with-credentials.test.ts` - Fixed mock methods
  - `src/config/__tests__/timeout.test.ts` - Pending
  - `src/credentials/__tests__/manager.test.ts` - Pending
  - `src/external/__tests__/api-client.test.ts` - Pending
  - `src/external/__tests__/pr-integration.test.ts` - Pending
  - `src/__tests__/ai/anthropic-vending.test.ts` - Pending

- **Tests with Issues**: 34 remaining (down from 42)
  - Config transformation issues in unified-processor-credentials.test.ts
  - Remaining test files need mock method fixes

## Recommendations

1. **Remove Obsolete Tests**: Delete the parseSolution tests as they test non-existent functionality
2. **Document E2E Requirements**: Create a guide for running E2E tests with proper credentials
3. **Track Bun Issues**: Monitor Bun's progress on mock pollution fixes
4. **Prioritize Integration Tests**: These are the most valuable tests affected by mock pollution
5. **Consider Test Migration**: Evaluate moving critical integration tests to a more stable test runner
