  "summary": "The data processing pipeline has performance issues for large datasets due to inefficient algorithms, in-memory processing, and redundant data passes.",
  "complexity": "medium",
  "estimatedTime": 180,
  "potentialFixes": [
    "Use a more efficient sorting algorithm with better time complexity",
    "Process the data in chunks instead of loading it all into memory",
    "Optimize the pipeline to minimize passes over the data",
    "Leverage Node.js streams more effectively for data processing"

  "requiredChanges": [
    "Replace the current sorting algorithm with a more efficient one, such as Quicksort or Merge sort",
    "Refactor the code to process data in smaller chunks using Node.js streams",
    "Identify and eliminate redundant data passes in the pipeline",
    "Optimize stream usage to minimize memory consumption"
