    "body": "\nOur data processing pipeline is experiencing performance issues when handling datasets larger than 10MB.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Submit a processing task with a dataset of 15MB or larger\n2. Observe high CPU usage and memory consumption\n3. Note that processing time scales non-linearly with dataset size\n\nProfiling has identified a few hotspots:\n- The sorting algorithm used in the preprocessing step has O(n²) complexity\n- We're loading the entire dataset into memory at once\n- Multiple passes are being made over the same data\n\nExpected behavior:\n- Processing time should scale linearly with dataset size\n- Memory usage should remain within reasonable bounds regardless of input size\n- CPU utilization should be optimized\n\nTechnical details:\n- Implementation is in TypeScript\n- The processing pipeline uses Node.js streams but not efficiently\n- The current implementation is in src/processing/dataProcessor.ts\n    ",
