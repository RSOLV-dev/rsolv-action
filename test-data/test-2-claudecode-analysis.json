  "summary": "The data processing pipeline has performance issues for large datasets due to inefficient algorithms, memory usage, and repeated data scans.",
  "complexity": "medium",
  "estimatedTime": 180,
  "potentialFixes": [
    "Replace the O(nÂ²) sorting algorithm with an efficient O(n log n) algorithm like Quicksort or Mergesort",
    "Implement streaming processing to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory at once",
    "Optimize the pipeline to minimize passes over the data by combining operations when possible"

  "recommendedApproach": "Implement streaming processing with Node.js streams, replace the sorting algorithm, and optimize the pipeline for fewer data passes.",

  "requiredChanges": [
    "Replace the current sorting implementation with an optimized algorithm",
    "Refactor the pipeline to use Node.js streams efficiently for processing data in chunks",
    "Analyze the pipeline to identify operations that can be combined to reduce passes over the data",
    "Update error handling and logging to accommodate streaming processing"
