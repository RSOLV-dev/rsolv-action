# Pre-Production Deployment Checklist

## âœ… Infrastructure Readiness

### Staging Environment
- [x] RSOLV-api deployed and healthy
- [x] RSOLV-landing deployed and healthy  
- [x] Database connectivity verified
- [x] BEAM clustering operational (2+ nodes)
- [x] Monitoring stack functional
- [x] Health endpoints responding

### API Functionality
- [x] Pattern API serving patterns correctly
- [x] Django framework patterns available
- [x] Fix attempt tracking operational
- [x] Authentication working (Bearer tokens)
- [x] AI provider health checks passing

## âœ… Test Suite Status

### Core Tests (Must Pass)
- [x] Security module tests (82/82 passing)
- [x] Configuration tests (13/13 passing)
- [x] Pattern API client tests
- [x] External API client tests

### Known Exclusions (Documented)
- [ ] Claude Code CLI tests (requires CLI - use mocks)
- [ ] Docker container tests (optional feature)
- [ ] Linear adapter tests (mock issues)
- [ ] Full E2E workflow tests (covered by staging)

## âœ… Integration Tests

### RSOLV-action + RSOLV-api
- [x] Pattern fetching from API
- [x] Security analysis with fetched patterns
- [x] Fix attempt tracking
- [x] Health check integration
- [x] 83% success rate on E2E tests

### Staging Validation
- [x] All services healthy
- [x] Cross-service communication working
- [x] Database operations functional
- [x] No critical errors in logs

## ðŸ”§ Recommended Fixes Before Production

### High Priority
1. **Test Suite**: Run `./test-green-suite.sh` and ensure 100% pass rate
2. **Linear Adapter**: Fix mock issues if Linear support needed
3. **Verify Secrets**: Ensure production secrets are properly configured

### Medium Priority  
1. **Claude Code Mocks**: Add proper mocks for CI/CD
2. **E2E Tests**: Create simplified E2E tests that don't require full environment
3. **Load Testing**: Run basic load tests on staging

### Low Priority
1. **Security Demo**: Implement demo environment
2. **Test Coverage**: Improve coverage for edge cases
3. **Documentation**: Update any outdated docs

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Staging Verification
```bash
./validate-staging.sh
./test-green-suite.sh
```

### 2. Production Deployment (RSOLV-api)
```bash
cd RSOLV-infrastructure
# Update production image tag
# Apply production deployment
kubectl apply -k environments/production/
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Check health
curl https://api.rsolv.dev/health | jq

# Verify patterns
curl https://api.rsolv.dev/api/v1/patterns/javascript | jq '.patterns | length'

# Test clustering
kubectl logs -l app=rsolv-api -n rsolv-production | grep "Node connected"
```

### 4. Monitor for Issues
- Watch Grafana dashboards
- Check error logs
- Monitor response times
- Verify fix attempt tracking

## ðŸš¦ Go/No-Go Criteria

### Go (Deploy to Production)
- [x] All staging validations pass
- [x] Core test suite is green
- [x] No critical bugs in staging
- [x] API response times < 500ms
- [x] Clustering verified working

### No-Go (Fix First)
- [ ] Any core test failures
- [ ] Database connectivity issues
- [ ] AI provider failures
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities found
- [ ] Performance degradation

## ðŸ“ž Rollback Plan

If issues arise in production:

1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous image tag
   ```bash
   kubectl set image deployment/rsolv-api rsolv-api=ghcr.io/rsolv-dev/rsolv-api:previous-tag -n rsolv-production
   ```

2. **Verify**: Check health and functionality
3. **Investigate**: Review logs and metrics
4. **Fix Forward**: Implement fixes and redeploy through staging

## âœ… Sign-Off

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All stakeholders notified
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled (if needed)
- [ ] Rollback plan reviewed
- [ ] On-call engineer available
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
