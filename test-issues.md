# Testing Issues in RSOLV Project

## Overview

We've identified several testing issues that need to be resolved to ensure our test suite is accurate and reliable. These issues are affecting components from Days 1-5.

## Current Test Issues

### 1. Missing Dependency: Nodemailer

**Affected Component:** External webhook system (Day 4: Expert Review)
**Issue:** The test suite cannot find the 'nodemailer' package which is used in the expert review notification system.
**Error:**
```
Cannot find package 'nodemailer' from '/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action/src/external/webhook.ts'
```
**Files Affected:**
- `src/external/webhook.ts`
- `src/external/__tests__/webhook.test.ts`

**Recommendation:** Add nodemailer as a dependency to the project.

### 2. Ollama Provider Tests

**Affected Component:** Ollama AI Provider (Day 3: AI Integration)
**Issue:** When running the entire test suite, Ollama provider tests fail, but they pass when run individually.
**Failed Tests:**
- `OllamaClient > should analyze an issue and return analysis data`
- `OllamaClient > should generate a solution and return PR data`
- `OllamaClient > should handle JSON in code blocks from API response`

**Recommendation:** Investigate potential test interactions or mocking issues that could be causing this behavior.

### 3. Claude Code Adapter Tests

**Affected Component:** Claude Code Adapter (Day 5: Claude Code Integration)
**Issue:** Similar to the Ollama tests, when running all tests together, some Claude Code adapter tests fail, but pass when run individually.
**Failed Tests:**
- `Claude Code Adapter > constructor should initialize with provided values`
- `Claude Code Adapter > constructPrompt should prioritize enhanced prompt when provided`
- `Claude Code Adapter > constructPrompt should create default prompt when no enhanced prompt provided`
- `Claude Code Adapter > parseSolution should handle direct JSON in text content`
- `Claude Code Adapter > parseSolution should handle JSON in code blocks`
- `Claude Code Adapter > parseSolution should fall back to default solution if parsing fails`

**Error:** 
```
TypeError: new ClaudeCodeAdapter(mockConfig).parseSolution is not a function
```

**Recommendation:** Check for mock interference between different test files or isolation issues.

## Impact Assessment

These issues are mainly related to testing and do not appear to affect the actual functionality of the code in production. However, they do indicate potential areas where our test isolation could be improved.

The issues span across Days 3, 4, and 5 deliverables:
- Day 3 (AI Integration): Ollama provider tests
- Day 4 (Expert Review): Nodemailer dependency missing
- Day 5 (Claude Code Integration): Claude Code adapter tests

## Root Cause Analysis

The most likely causes of these issues are:

1. **Mock Interference**: When running all tests together, mock configurations from one test may be affecting others.
   
2. **Missing Dependencies**: The nodemailer package appears to be used but not installed.

3. **Global State**: There may be shared global state that isn't being properly reset between tests.

## Action Items

1. Install nodemailer as a dependency to fix the webhook tests.

2. Improve test isolation for both Ollama provider and Claude Code adapter tests.

3. Consider using a more robust testing approach that ensures tests are truly isolated from each other.

4. Add test cleanup steps to reset any shared state between test runs.
