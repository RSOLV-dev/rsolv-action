# RFC-008 Git History Sanitization Complete

**Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Completed  
**Repository**: RSOLV-action

## Summary

Successfully removed all proprietary security patterns from git history to protect intellectual property. The patterns are now served dynamically from the private RSOLV-api repository.

## What Was Removed

- **3,739 lines** of proprietary pattern code across 10 files:
  - `src/security/patterns/` directory (entire directory)
  - `src/security/patterns.ts` (old pattern registry)
  - `src/security/tiered-pattern-source.ts` (old tiered system)
  - Pattern test files that contained pattern data

## Repository Impact

- **Before**: Repository contained 448 proprietary security patterns
- **After**: Only 3 minimal public patterns remain as fallback
- **Size Reduction**: Repository now 872KB (significantly reduced)
- **History**: All commits modified to remove pattern files

## Verification

```bash
# Verify no pattern files in history
git log --all --oneline -- "src/security/patterns/*" | wc -l
# Result: 0

# Check repository size
du -sh .git
# Result: 872K
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Notify Team**: All developers must delete and re-clone the repository
2. ⚠️ **GitHub Actions**: Need to deprecate/unpublish old releases (v1.0.0 - v1.0.7)
3. ✅ **Production**: Pattern API already serving patterns from RSOLV-api
4. ✅ **Testing**: All tests passing with minimal fallback patterns

## Important Notes

- The force push has rewritten history - all existing clones are now invalid
- Old GitHub Action versions still contain the patterns and should be deprecated
- The pattern API at https://api.rsolv.dev/api/v1/patterns is fully operational
- RSOLV-action now only contains 3 basic public patterns as fallback

## Security Status

✅ **IP Protected**: All proprietary patterns removed from public repository  
✅ **API Working**: Dynamic pattern loading from private RSOLV-api  
✅ **Fallback Ready**: Basic patterns available if API is unavailable  
⚠️ **Action Required**: Deprecate old GitHub Action releases
