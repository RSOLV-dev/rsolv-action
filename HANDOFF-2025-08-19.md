# Session Handoff - August 19, 2025

## Current Status

### âœ… RFC-045: Validation Confidence Scoring - COMPLETE
**Implementation**: 100% complete, tests passing
- Created `src/validation/types.ts` with confidence types
- Added `EnhancedValidationEnricher` to `src/validation/enricher.ts`
- Updated `src/modes/phase-executor/index.ts` to use new enricher
- Removed synthetic data workaround for command injection
- All 10 unit tests passing

**Key Achievement**: System now returns confidence scores (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/REVIEW) instead of binary validation, and NEVER returns 0 vulnerabilities if the scan found any.

### ðŸ”„ RFC-046: Multi-file Vulnerability Chunking - PENDING
**Status**: Not started
**Next Steps**: 
1. Write failing tests for chunking logic
2. Implement VulnerabilityChunker class
3. Update PR creation for multi-PR series
4. Test with 14-file DoS vulnerability

### ðŸ”„ RFC-047: Vendor Library Detection - PENDING
**Status**: Not started
**Next Steps**:
1. Write tests for vendor detection
2. Implement VendorDetector class
3. Create update recommendations instead of patches
4. Test with jQuery false positive

## Testing Limitations Discovered

### Local Environment Issues
1. **Pattern API Access**: Returns 404 locally, falls back to 24 minimal patterns
2. **Mode Selection**: Use `RSOLV_MODE=mitigate` not `RSOLV_ACTION_MODE`
3. **Credential Vending**: Should use platform vended credentials, not direct API keys
4. **Timeout**: Default bash timeout is 2 minutes, may need longer for full runs

### Working Command Examples
```bash
# For local testing (limited patterns)
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=RSOLV-dev/nodegoat-vulnerability-demo \
RSOLV_MODE=mitigate \
DISABLE_FIX_VALIDATION=true \
GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_CR_PAT \
RSOLV_API_KEY=$RSOLV_INTERNAL_API_KEY \
RSOLV_ISSUE_NUMBER=320 \
node dist/index.js

# For unit tests
bun test src/validation/__tests__/confidence-scoring.test.ts
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action/src/validation/__tests__/confidence-scoring.test.ts`
- `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action/test-preload.ts`

- `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RFCs/RFC-047-vendor-library-detection.md`

### Modified Files
- `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action/src/validation/enricher.ts` - Added EnhancedValidationEnricher
- `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action/src/modes/phase-executor/index.ts` - Removed synthetic workaround
- `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action/E2E-TEST-COVERAGE.md` - Updated with RFC-045 results

### Files to Clean Up
- `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action/test-validation.js` - Temporary test file
- `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RSOLV-action/.github/rsolv.yml` - Has test config that was modified

## Key Context for Next Session

### What We Achieved
1. **Eliminated false negatives**: Validation enricher never returns empty when vulnerabilities exist
2. **Confidence scoring**: Replaces binary yes/no with nuanced assessment
3. **Removed workarounds**: No more synthetic data creation for command injection

### What's Next
1. **RFC-046**: Chunk multi-file vulnerabilities (DoS with 14 files failing)
2. **RFC-047**: Detect vendor libraries (jQuery false positive)
3. **E2E Testing**: Need to test in GitHub Actions or staging (local has API limitations)

### Known Issues
- Local testing limited by API access (404 on pattern endpoints)
- Some workflows still failing (hardcoded secrets, DoS, open redirect)
- Need proper credential vending instead of direct API keys

## Resume Instructions

To continue work in the next session:

1. **Start with this context**:
   ```
   Please read HANDOFF-2025-08-19.md for our current status. 
   We just completed RFC-045 (Validation Confidence Scoring).
   Next is RFC-046 (Multi-file Chunking) using TDD approach.
   ```

2. **Verify implementation**:
   ```bash
   # Check tests still pass
   bun test src/validation/__tests__/confidence-scoring.test.ts
   
   # Verify build works
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Continue with RFC-046**:
   - Start with writing failing tests for chunking
   - Focus on 14-file DoS vulnerability as test case
   - Remember TDD: Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor â†’ Review

4. **Reference documents**:
   - Implementation plan: `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2025-08-19.md`
   - RFC details: `/home/dylan/dev/rsolv/RFCs/RFC-046-multi-file-vulnerability-chunking.md`
   - Test baseline: `E2E-TEST-COVERAGE.md`

## Ready for Commit

The implementation is stable and ready to commit. All tests pass, and the system is functionally improved even if we can't fully test locally due to API limitations.
