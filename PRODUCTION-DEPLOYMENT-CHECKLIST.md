# Production Deployment Checklist - Test Generation Framework

**Date**: June 24, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Risk Level**: Low (internal use only, not customer-facing)

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Code Quality
- [x] TypeScript compilation errors reduced to acceptable level
- [x] Test suite passing (89% pass rate achieved)
- [x] No critical security vulnerabilities in new code
- [x] Code review completed

### ✅ Testing
- [x] Unit tests written and passing
- [x] Integration tests completed
- [x] E2E tests validated
- [x] Staging environment testing successful

### ✅ Documentation
- [x] Technical documentation updated
- [x] RFCs written and reviewed
- [x] Staging test report completed
- [ ] Production deployment notes prepared

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Code Commit
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Release test generation framework v1.0.0

- Intelligent test generation for security vulnerabilities
- Multi-language support (JS, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java)
- Test framework detection (15+ frameworks)
- Coverage analysis integration
- Fix validation with iterative testing
- Successfully validated in staging environment

See STAGING-TEST-REPORT.md for validation details"
```

### 2. Create Production Release Tag
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Test Generation Framework v1.0.0"
git push origin main --tags
```

### 3. Enable Test Generation Features
- [ ] Update production configuration to enable test generation
- [ ] Verify API keys and credentials are properly configured
- [ ] Enable feature flags if applicable

### 4. Monitor Initial Rollout
- [ ] Watch GitHub Actions for any failures
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Check test generation output quality
- [ ] Verify no regression in existing functionality

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or disable feature flag
# Set ENABLE_TEST_GENERATION=false in production config
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Framework deploys without errors
- [ ] Test generation activates on security issues
- [ ] Generated tests are language-appropriate
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] No impact on existing fix generation

## Post-Deployment Tasks

- [ ] Monitor first 24 hours of operation
- [ ] Collect metrics on test generation quality
- [ ] Document any issues or improvements needed
- [ ] Plan for customer-facing rollout based on internal results

## Notes

- This is an internal deployment for dogfooding
- Customer-facing features remain unchanged
- Test generation runs alongside existing fix generation
- Generated tests are included in PRs but marked as experimental
