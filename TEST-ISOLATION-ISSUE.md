# Test Isolation Issue in RSOLV-action

## Summary
Some tests in the project pass when run individually but fail when run as part of the entire test suite. This suggests there are issues with test isolation, where tests are interfering with each other.

## Affected Components

### 1. Claude Code Adapter Tests
- Claude Code adapter tests work when run individually: `bun test src/ai/adapters/__tests__/claude-code.test.ts`
- They fail when run as part of the full test suite: `bun test`
- Error: `TypeError: new ClaudeCodeAdapter(mockConfig).parseSolution is not a function`

### 2. Ollama Provider Tests
- Ollama provider tests work when run individually: `bun test src/ai/providers/__tests__/ollama.test.ts`
- They fail when run as part of the full test suite: `bun test`
- Errors include failing assertions for analysis and solution generation

## Root Causes

1. **Module Mocking Interference**: 
   - When multiple test files mock the same modules differently, they can interfere with each other
   - The Bun test runner might not be resetting mocks properly between test files

2. **Global State**:
   - Some modules might be maintaining global state that isn't properly reset between tests
   - This is particularly problematic for modules like fs and child_process

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Mock Isolation**:
   - Ensure each test file's mocks are isolated and don't affect other test files
   - Consider using unique module paths for mocks in different test files

2. **Reset State Between Tests**:
   - Add cleanup steps in the afterEach or afterAll hooks to reset any modified state
   - Consider using a global setup and teardown mechanism

3. **Consider Test Runner Options**:
   - Investigate if Bun has options for better test isolation
   - Consider testing if each test file runs in a separate environment

4. **Module Structure Improvements**:
   - Refactor modules to be more amenable to mocking and testing
   - Inject dependencies rather than importing them directly

## Impact

These test failures don't indicate issues with the actual functionality of the code. All failures are related to test infrastructure rather than actual code bugs:

- The Claude Code adapter integration works correctly in manual testing
- The Ollama provider works correctly when tested individually

## Temporary Solution

For now, we should:

1. Continue running individual tests when making changes to specific components
2. Focus on addressing this issue in a future update dedicated to improving the test infrastructure
3. Document known test isolation issues in the codebase
4. Consider adding a warning message when running the full test suite

## Priority

Medium - This doesn't block development as tests can still be run individually.
