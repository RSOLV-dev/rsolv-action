# RSOLV API Service

[![Elixir CI](https://github.com/RSOLV-dev/rsolv/actions/workflows/elixir-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RSOLV-dev/rsolv/actions/workflows/elixir-ci.yml)

Backend API service for the RSOLV automated issue fixing platform.

## Overview

This API service handles:

- **Security Pattern Serving**: 181 vulnerability detection patterns across 8 languages
- **Authentication and authorization**: API key management and credential vending
- **Usage tracking and metrics**: Billing and usage analytics
- **Expert review request management**: Human-in-the-loop workflows
- **Customer dashboard data**: Analytics and reporting

## Architecture

The RSOLV API is built with Phoenix/Elixir for reliability and scalability. It provides the central coordination point between GitHub Actions, expert reviewers, and customer dashboards.

### Architecture Documentation

We maintain comprehensive architecture documentation using:

- **[RFCs (Request for Comments)](RFCs/RFC-INDEX.md)**: Proposals for new features and architectural changes (53+ RFCs)
- **[ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)](ADRs/ADR-INDEX.md)**: Documented decisions that have been implemented (24+ ADRs)

Key architectural decisions include:
- Credential vending architecture for secure API key management
- Three-phase security architecture (SCAN → VALIDATE → MITIGATE)
- AST-based validation reducing false positives by 70-90%
- Service consolidation for 50% infrastructure cost reduction

## Security

The API is designed with security as a top priority, ensuring:

- No customer source code is ever stored or processed by the API
- Only metadata about issues and fixes is transmitted
- All communication is encrypted with TLS
- API keys are required for all requests

## Development Setup

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rsolv/platform
cd platform

# One-command setup (handles everything)
mix setup

# Start the Phoenix server
mix phx.server
```

The setup will automatically:
- ✅ Check for `.env` file (offers interactive wizard if missing)
- ✅ Validate system requirements (Elixir, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- ✅ Install dependencies and compile assets
- ✅ Create database and run migrations
- ✅ Load test data with credentials
- ✅ Verify everything works

**📚 For detailed setup instructions, troubleshooting, and advanced options, see [docs/DEV_SETUP.md](docs/DEV_SETUP.md)**

### Environment Variables

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for a complete list of configuration options.

**Required:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (default: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/rsolv_dev`)
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE` - Phoenix secret (auto-generated by `mix dev.env.setup`)

**Optional:**
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude AI features
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For OpenAI features
- `POSTMARK_API_KEY` - For transactional emails

**Tip:** Run `mix dev.env.setup` for an interactive wizard to configure these.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite
mix test

# Run tests with detailed output
mix test --trace

# Run a specific test file
mix test test/rsolv_web/controllers/pattern_controller_test.exs

# Run tests with coverage (if configured)
mix test --cover
```

### Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline runs automatically on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests targeting `main` or `develop`
- Manual workflow dispatch

#### CI Jobs

1. **Test Suite** - Runs the full Elixir test suite with PostgreSQL
2. **OpenAPI Spec Validation** - Generates and validates the OpenAPI specification
3. **Code Quality** - Checks code formatting and compilation warnings
4. **Migration Integrity** - Verifies database migrations are reversible (up/down/up)
5. **Asset Compilation** - Builds frontend assets (Tailwind CSS, esbuild)

#### Status Checks

**Note:** Some checks (tests, asset compilation, migration rollback, formatting, and warnings enforcement) are presently non-fatal or disabled in the CI workflow. The guarantees below reflect intended coverage, but not all failures will block merges until the workflow is tightened.

The CI pipeline currently runs:
- ✅ All tests (non-fatal; failures do not block merges)
- ✅ OpenAPI spec generation (fatal; failures block merges)
- ✅ Code formatting (`mix format --check-formatted`) (non-fatal)
- ✅ Compilation warnings (non-fatal)
- ✅ Migration reversibility (non-fatal)
- ✅ Database seeds
- ✅ Asset compilation (non-fatal)
#### Running CI Checks Locally

Before pushing, you can run the same checks locally:

```bash
# Run tests
mix test

# Check code formatting
mix format --check-formatted

# Fix formatting issues
mix format

# Compile with warnings as errors
mix compile --warnings-as-errors

# Generate OpenAPI spec
mix rsolv.openapi priv/static/openapi.json

# Verify migrations
mix ecto.migrate
mix ecto.rollback --all
mix ecto.migrate
mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs

# Build assets
mix assets.build
```
