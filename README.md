# RSOLV GitHub Action

Automate fixing issues in your repository using AI.

## Overview

RSOLV is a GitHub Action that helps software development teams address their maintenance backlog by automatically fixing issues. The action connects to your issue tracker, identifies items tagged for automation, uses AI to analyze and fix issues, and creates clean pull requests for human review.

## Features

- üîç Automatically detects issues tagged for automation
- ü§ñ Uses AI to analyze issues and generate solutions
- üõ°Ô∏è Runs in a secure, containerized environment
- üîÄ Creates pull requests with detailed descriptions
- üîó Supports external issue trackers (Jira, Linear)
- üîê Secure by design - no source code leaves your repository
