# RSOLV API Service

Backend API service for the RSOLV automated issue fixing platform.

## Overview

This API service handles:

- **Security Pattern Serving**: 448+ vulnerability detection patterns across 8 languages
- **Authentication and authorization**: API key management and credential vending
- **Usage tracking and metrics**: Billing and usage analytics
- **Expert review request management**: Human-in-the-loop workflows
- **Customer dashboard data**: Analytics and reporting

## Architecture

The RSOLV API is built with Phoenix/Elixir for reliability and scalability. It provides the central coordination point between GitHub Actions, expert reviewers, and customer dashboards.

## Security

The API is designed with security as a top priority, ensuring:

- No customer source code is ever stored or processed by the API
- Only metadata about issues and fixes is transmitted
- All communication is encrypted with TLS
- API keys are required for all requests

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Setup the database
mix ecto.setup

# Start the Phoenix server
mix phx.server
```
