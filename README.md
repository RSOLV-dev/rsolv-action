## Installation

Add the following to your workflow file:

```yaml
name: RSOLV Automation

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled, edited]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Run every 6 hours

jobs:
  automate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run RSOLV
        uses: RSOLV-dev/rsolv-action@v2
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.RSOLV_API_KEY }}
          issue_label: 'rsolv:automate'  # Optional: custom label
```

## Configuration

RSOLV can be configured using a `.github/rsolv.yml` file in your repository:

```yaml
# AI Provider configuration
aiProvider:
  provider: anthropic  # anthropic, openai, mistral, or ollama
  model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229
  useVendedCredentials: true  # Use RSOLV's credential vending service
  temperature: 0.2
  maxTokens: 4000

# Container configuration
containerConfig:
  enabled: true
  image: rsolv/code-analysis:latest
  memoryLimit: 2g
  cpuLimit: 1
  timeout: 300
  securityProfile: default

# Security settings
securitySettings:
  disableNetworkAccess: true
  scanDependencies: true
  preventSecretLeakage: true
  maxFileSize: 1048576  # 1 MB
  timeoutSeconds: 300
  requireCodeReview: true
```

## Proactive Security Scanning

RSOLV can proactively scan your repository for vulnerabilities and create issues for discovered problems:

```yaml
name: Weekly Security Scan
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Weekly on Mondays

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: RSOLV-dev/rsolv-action@main
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.RSOLV_API_KEY }}
          scan_mode: scan  # Enable proactive scanning
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This will:
1. Scan your entire repository for security vulnerabilities
2. Group similar vulnerabilities together
3. Create GitHub issues with detailed descriptions
4. Apply the `rsolv:automate` label for processing

See [docs/SCAN-MODE.md](docs/SCAN-MODE.md) for complete documentation.

## Enhanced Context and Performance Optimizations

RSOLV includes several features for optimizing performance and token usage:

### Single-Pass Processing (Default)

RSOLV now uses single-pass processing by default, combining context gathering and solution generation:

```yaml
# Single-pass is enabled by default - no configuration needed
# To enable enhanced context (two-pass) mode:
- uses: RSOLV-dev/rsolv-action@v1
  with:
    enable_enhanced_context: 'true'
```

### Features

- **Single-Pass Processing**: Reduces token usage by ~50% and processing time by 40-60%
- **Credential Singleton**: Prevents multiple API authentications, improving reliability
- **AI Conversation Logging**: Debug AI interactions for troubleshooting (development only)
- **Enhanced Pattern Support**: Supports latest API patterns with regex field handling

### Advanced Configuration

For scenarios requiring deeper analysis, you can enable enhanced context:

```yaml
# Enable enhanced context for complex issues
- uses: RSOLV-dev/rsolv-action@v1
  with:
    api_key: ${{ secrets.RSOLV_API_KEY }}
    enable_enhanced_context: 'true'  # Opt-in for deeper analysis
  env:
    RSOLV_CONTEXT_DEPTH: 'deep'  # shallow, medium, deep, or ultra
```

### Debugging AI Conversations (Development Only)

For debugging AI interactions during development:

```yaml
# Enable conversation logging
env:
  AI_CONVERSATION_LOG_LEVEL: 'full'  # or 'summary' or 'none'
  AI_CONVERSATION_LOG_DIR: '/tmp/ai-conversation-logs'

# Upload logs as artifacts
- name: Upload AI Conversation Logs
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: always()
  with:
    name: ai-conversation-logs
    path: /tmp/ai-conversation-logs/
```

**Note**: This feature is for development only and should be removed before production use.

### Configuration

```yaml
# Advanced configuration
env:
  RSOLV_CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG: |
    {
      "enableDeepContext": true,
      "enableUltraThink": true,
      "contextDepth": "ultra",
      "contextGatheringTimeout": 300000,
      "analyzeArchitecture": true,
      "analyzeTestPatterns": true,
      "analyzeStyleGuide": true,
      "contextOptions": {
        "includeDirs": ["src", "lib", "tests"],
        "excludeDirs": ["node_modules", "dist"]
      }
    }
```

- [Prompts Architecture](docs/PROMPTS-ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Credential Vending Service

RSOLV simplifies AI integration by providing a credential vending service:

- **Single API Key**: Just one RSOLV API key - we manage all AI provider relationships
- **Temporary Credentials**: Secure, time-limited AI provider credentials
- **Direct API Access**: GitHub Action makes direct API calls for optimal performance
- **Usage Tracking**: Automatically tracks AI usage for billing

How it works:
1. GitHub Action exchanges RSOLV API key for temporary AI provider credentials
2. Temporary credentials are used to make direct API calls
3. Credentials automatically expire after 1 hour
4. All usage is tracked and billed to your RSOLV account

To use:
```yaml
aiProvider:
  useVendedCredentials: true  # Enable credential vending
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the action:

- `RSOLV_API_KEY`: Your RSOLV API key (required)
- `RSOLV_API_URL`: API endpoint (default: `https://api.rsolv.dev`)
- `RSOLV_CONFIG_PATH`: Path to the configuration file (default: `.github/rsolv.yml`)
- `RSOLV_ISSUE_LABEL`: Label to identify issues for automation (default: `rsolv:automate`)
- `RSOLV_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`: JSON string of environment variables to pass to the container

## External Issue Trackers

RSOLV supports multiple issue tracking platforms beyond GitHub Issues:

### Jira Integration

```bash
# Set Jira credentials
export JIRA_HOST="your-domain.atlassian.net"
export JIRA_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-jira-api-token"

# Optional: Custom labels (defaults shown)
export JIRA_AUTOFIX_LABEL="autofix"
export JIRA_RSOLV_LABEL="rsolv"
```

See [Jira Integration Guide](docs/jira-integration.md) for detailed setup.

### Linear Integration

```bash
# Set Linear API key
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_YOUR_KEY_HERE"

# Optional: Team ID and custom labels
export LINEAR_TEAM_ID="your-team-id"
export LINEAR_AUTOFIX_LABEL="autofix"
export LINEAR_RSOLV_LABEL="rsolv"
```

See [Linear Integration Guide](docs/linear-integration.md) for detailed setup.

### GitLab Integration (Coming Soon)

GitLab issue tracking integration is under development.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### File paths in GitHub Issues

When creating issues that reference file paths, always use **relative paths** instead of absolute paths:

- ‚úÖ **Correct**: `app/data/allocations-dao.js`
- ‚ùå **Wrong**: `/app/data/allocations-dao.js`

**Why?** GitHub Actions runs in a containerized environment where the repository is mounted at `/github/workspace`. Absolute paths will cause RSOLV to look in the wrong location and either fail to find files or create new files in unexpected places.

**Example Issue Body**:
```markdown
There is a NoSQL injection vulnerability in app/data/allocations-dao.js at line 78.
The code uses string interpolation in a MongoDB $where clause.
```

#### Pull Request Creation Failures

If RSOLV fails to create a pull request:
1. Check that the workflow has `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions
2. Verify the GITHUB_TOKEN is properly configured
3. Check action logs for specific error messages

#### Timeout Issues

For complex vulnerabilities, RSOLV may take longer than expected:
- Default timeout is 60 minutes
- Can be adjusted in your workflow configuration
- Consider processing one issue at a time for complex fixes

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (latest version)
- Docker (for container testing)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rsolv-dev/action.git
cd action

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run tests
bun test

# Type check
bun run typecheck

# Lint
bun run lint
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun test --watch

# Run tests in isolation (recommended for CI/CD)
# This avoids mock pollution issues between test files
bun run test:isolated
```

**Note**: Due to Bun's test framework limitations, some tests may fail when run together but pass individually. Use `test:isolated` for accurate results.
