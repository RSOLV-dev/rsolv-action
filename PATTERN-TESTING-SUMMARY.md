# Pattern Testing Summary

## Current Status (June 18, 2025)

### Pattern Availability
- **Total Patterns in Production API**: 61 (public tier only)
  - JavaScript: 17 patterns
  - Python: 6 patterns  
  - Ruby: 8 patterns
  - Java: 4 patterns
  - PHP: 11 patterns
  - Elixir: 15 patterns

### Detection Results
- **JavaScript**: ✅ XSS detection working
- **Python**: ❌ SQL injection not detected (pattern may not be in public tier)
- **Ruby**: ✅ XSS detection working

### Key Findings
1. **API Access**: Currently only returning public tier patterns
2. **Pattern Source Integration**: ✅ Working correctly - fetches from API and caches
3. **Detector Integration**: ✅ Working - uses patterns from source
4. **Detection Accuracy**: Mixed - depends on pattern availability in public tier

### Issues Identified
1. **Limited Pattern Set**: Only 61 patterns available vs 448 expected
   - This appears to be intentional tier-based access control
   - Full pattern library requires enterprise API access

2. **Pattern Coverage Gaps**:
   - SQL injection patterns not available for Python in public tier
   - Command injection patterns missing across languages
   - Path traversal patterns not available

### Recommendations
1. **For Testing**: Create batch testing approach to avoid timeouts
2. **For Production**: Ensure proper API key with full access before launch
3. **For Validation**: Test with known vulnerable code samples that match available patterns

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Pattern API integration verified and working
2. ✅ Detection mechanism functional with available patterns  
3. ⚠️ Need to verify full pattern access for production use
4. ⚠️ Consider implementing pattern tier documentation for customers
