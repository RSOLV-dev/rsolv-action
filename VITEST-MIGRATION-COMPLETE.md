# Vitest Migration Complete - 2025-08-24

## Summary
Successfully migrated test suite from Bun to Vitest to resolve module mocking issues.

## Migration Stats
- **Files Migrated**: 139 test files
- **Time Taken**: ~30 minutes
- **Lines Changed**: ~3,600 lines

## Key Changes

### 1. Import Updates
```typescript
// Before (Bun)
import { describe, it, expect, mock, jest } from 'bun:test';

// After (Vitest)
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
```

### 2. Mock Changes
```typescript
// Before (Bun - problematic)
mock.module('../src/module', () => ({ ... }));

// After (Vitest - works reliably)
vi.mock('../src/module', () => ({ ... }));
```

### 3. Configuration
- Added `vitest.config.ts` with proper test setup
- Created `test/vitest-setup.ts` for global mocks
- Updated `package.json` scripts

## Test Status

### Working Directories
- ✅ src/credentials - Tests passing
- ✅ test/ai - Tests passing  
- ✅ Basic unit tests working

### Known Issues
- Some timing-sensitive tests need adjustment
- AST service integration tests need review
- Some mocks need hoisting adjustment

## Benefits Gained

1. **Reliable Module Mocking**: vi.mock() properly hoists and isolates
2. **Better Test Isolation**: No more mock pollution between files
3. **No Dangling Processes**: Vitest handles cleanup properly
4. **Mature Ecosystem**: Better documentation and community support

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining test failures (mostly timing/mock issues)
2. Update CI pipeline to use Vitest
3. Remove Bun test configuration files
4. Update documentation

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific directory
npm test src/credentials

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Rollback Plan

If needed, can revert to Bun tests:
```bash
git checkout bun-test-attempt-2025-08-24
```

## Conclusion

Migration successful. While not all tests pass yet, the fundamental issues with Bun's module mocking are resolved. The remaining failures are fixable test issues, not framework limitations.
