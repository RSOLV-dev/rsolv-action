# Go-to-Market Launch Project (2025-10)

**Status:** In Progress - Weeks 0-3 Complete ✅
**Timeline:** Weeks 0-6 (Oct 23 - Dec 2025) - **~2 weeks ahead of schedule**
**Project Lead:** Dylan
**RFCs:** 064-069 (Master Plan, Provisioning, Billing, Marketplace, Testing, Integration Week)
**Current Phase:** Week 3 (100% complete) - Ready for integration to main

## Overview

This directory contains working documents for the 6-week go-to-market launch project, implementing RFCs 064-069 to transform RSOLV from manual provisioning to fully automated self-service with GitHub Marketplace presence.

## Development Approach

**Direct-to-Main Integration:** Actual implementation uses direct merges to `main` after CI validation (not integration branch).

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Strong CI pipeline validates every merge (tests, migrations, code quality)
- ✅ Sequential migration timestamps prevent conflicts
- ✅ Small, focused PRs enable fast review cycles
- ✅ Continuous integration on main allows flexible deployment
- ✅ Production can deploy anytime from green main

**Workflow:**
```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/rfc-065-some-feature
# ... implement with TDD ...
git commit -m "RFC-065: Feature description"
git push -u origin feature/rfc-065-some-feature
# Open PR → main, CI validates → merge
```

**Conflict Resolution:** Sequential migrations and isolated modules prevented all conflicts. No manual intervention needed.

## Marketplace Submission Status

### docs.rsolv.dev ✅ RESOLVED (Oct 25)
- ✅ **LIVE** at https://docs.rsolv.dev (HTTP 200)
- ✅ Installation guide (3-step Quick Start)
- ✅ Troubleshooting section
- ✅ API reference navigation
- **This blocker is now RESOLVED**

### Remaining Marketplace Blockers (HUMAN TASKS)
1. ⚠️ **Create 500x500px logo.png** - Graphic design required
   - Shield icon theme (matches branding)
   - Blue color scheme
   - High-quality PNG for marketplace

2. ⚠️ **Create screenshots** - Action in use
   - SCAN mode running
   - VALIDATE mode with test generation
   - MITIGATE mode creating PR
   - Example pull request with fixes

3. ⏳ **Testing validation** - Verify completeness
   - Test with NodeGoat (JavaScript vulnerabilities)
   - Test with RailsGoat (Ruby vulnerabilities)
   - Document results

4. ⏳ **Demo video** (optional but recommended)
   - 3-minute walkthrough: Install → First scan → PR created
   - Can use Loom or similar tool

**Timeline:** Complete human tasks before marketplace submission (originally Week 2, now Week 3)
