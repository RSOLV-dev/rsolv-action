## Response Protocol

### Response Time Targets
- **Critical questions** (bugs, billing issues): < 1 hour
- **Product questions**: < 2 hours
- **General engagement**: < 4 hours
- **Overnight comments**: Within 1 hour of 9am PT

### Escalation Path

3. **Technical issues**: Escalate to engineering immediately
4. **Billing issues**: Escalate to Stripe dashboard, verify payment status

---

## Contingency Planning

### If Technical Issues Arise
1. **Immediate**: Post status update on all channels ("Investigating issue...")
2. **Monitor**: Grafana dashboards for error rates, latency spikes
3. **Communicate**: Transparent updates every 30 minutes until resolved
4. **Rollback**: Feature flag toggles ready if critical bugs found
5. **Post-mortem**: Document incident, root cause, prevention

### If Marketplace Listing Delayed
1. **Soft launch**: Proceed with blog + social, note "Marketplace pending"
2. **Direct signup**: Drive traffic to rsolv.dev, manual provisioning if needed
3. **Full launch**: Repeat announcements when marketplace goes live

### If Overwhelming Response
1. **Scale**: Kubernetes auto-scaling configured, verify limits
2. **Support**: Prioritize paying customers, triage support queue
3. **Rate limits**: Monitor API rate limits, adjust if needed
4. **Communication**: "High demand, we're scaling" message (positive framing)

## Post-Launch Review (1 Week After)

### Review Questions
1. Which channel drove the most trial signups?
2. What was the conversion rate from each channel?
3. Which messaging resonated best (problem-solution vs. journey)?
4. What questions came up repeatedly (update FAQ)?
5. What technical issues occurred (root cause analysis)?
6. What would we do differently next time?

### Optimization Actions
- Update low-performing content based on engagement
- Double down on high-performing channels
- Adjust messaging based on customer feedback
- Refine UTM tracking (add new parameters if needed)
- Document learnings for future launches
