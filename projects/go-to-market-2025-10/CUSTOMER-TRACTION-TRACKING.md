# RSOLV Customer Traction Tracking

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23

## Overview

This document tracks customer development efforts for RSOLV, focusing on securing **3-5 committed beta testers** from quality warm network outreach.

**Launch Timeline:** ~6 weeks from 2025-10-23 (target: early December 2025)
**Current Status:** Pre-launch customer development phase

## Goals

- **Primary Goal:** 3-5 confirmed beta testers by end of Week 3 (2025-11-13)
- **Secondary Goal:** 5 quality outreach contacts identified by end of Week 0
- **Success Metric:** Testers who will actually install and use RSOLV on real repositories
- **Philosophy:** Quality over quantity - respectful outreach to people who'd genuinely benefit

## Beta Tester Criteria

**Ideal Beta Testers:**
- DevSecOps leads, security engineers, or backend developers
- Work with repositories that handle sensitive data or have security requirements
- Use GitHub Actions (required for current RSOLV implementation)
- Willing to provide feedback and report issues
- Based in our warm network (higher conversion rate)

**Value Proposition for Testers:**
- Unlimited free fixes during beta period
- Direct access to founder for support
- Influence on product direction and feature prioritization
- Early adopter recognition

## Outreach Template

```markdown
Subject: Would you beta test our AI security fixer?

Hey [Name],

I'm building RSOLV - an AI that validates security vulnerabilities before fixing them. Instead of guessing, it writes tests that FAIL (proving the bug), then fixes the code until tests pass.

We're launching in ~6 weeks. Would you be willing to test it on [their repo/company]? You'd get:
- Unlimited free fixes during beta
- Direct access to me for support
- Influence on product direction

Only catch: It's GitHub Actions only (for now).

Interested? I'll send early access in ~3 weeks when staging is ready.

- Dylan

- [ ] Security-focused communities (infosec.exchange, security Discords)
- [ ] Open source maintainers of security-related projects
- [ ] Previous clients or consulting contacts
- [ ] Fellow indie hackers working on dev tools

## Next Actions

**Immediate (This Week):**
1. [ ] Identify 5 quality warm network contacts with names and context
2. [ ] Draft personalized variations of outreach email for each contact
3. [ ] Send personalized outreach to all 5 contacts
4. [ ] Track responses and schedule follow-ups

**Week 1:**
1. [ ] Follow up (once) with non-responders from Week 0 (after 5-7 days)
2. [ ] Respond to interested parties with more details
3. [ ] Begin confirming beta testers (GitHub handles, repos to test)

**Week 2-3:**
1. [ ] Convert interested parties to confirmed testers (goal: 3-5)
2. [ ] Prepare beta testing infrastructure (staging access, docs)
3. [ ] Send beta invites to confirmed testers when ready
4. [ ] Consider additional outreach if needed (but keep it quality-focused)

## Notes & Learnings
