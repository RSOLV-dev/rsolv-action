# Demo Environment Enhancement Ideas

These are lightweight feature additions that could enhance the demo environment for testing and showcasing more functionality.

## 1. Compare AI Provider Performance

**Current limitation:** Users can test different AI providers but can't directly compare their outputs.

**Implementation:**
- Add a "Compare AI Providers" option to the menu
- Allow selecting two providers to run in parallel
- Generate solutions for the same issue with both providers
- Display a side-by-side comparison of:
  - Response time
  - Solution quality
  - Number of files changed
  - Tests proposed

**Code changes needed:**
- Add a new menu option
- Create a function to run two providers in parallel
- Add a side-by-side display formatter

## 2. Test Claude Code Integration in Depth

**Current limitation:** The Claude Code integration is mostly simulated and doesn't show the actual differences in context gathering.

**Implementation:**
- Add a "Test Claude Code Context" option
- Show a visual representation of what files are being analyzed
- Display context extraction progress in real-time
- Show before/after comparison of solutions with and without enhanced context

**Code changes needed:**
- Create a new menu option
- Add visual logging of the context-gathering process
- Implement actual context exploration (even if shallow)

## 3. Expert Review Workflow Simulation

**Current limitation:** PR creation is simulated but expert review workflow isn't demonstrated.

**Implementation:**
- Add "Simulate Expert Review" option
- Allow user to play the role of an expert
- Create a simple interface for reviewing the PR
- Show notification flow and templated responses
- Demonstrate how reviews are saved and processed

**Code changes needed:**
- Add a new menu option
- Create an expert review UI in the terminal
- Implement review saving

## 4. Timeline Visualization

**Current limitation:** No visualization of the entire process flow.

**Implementation:**
- Add a "Show Process Timeline" option
- Display a visual timeline of steps taken in the current session
- Show elapsed time at each step
- Highlight potential areas for optimization

**Code changes needed:**
- Add state tracking for timing information
- Create a simple ASCII timeline visualization
- Add a new menu option

## 5. Diff Preview for Generated Changes

**Current limitation:** Generated file changes are listed but not shown in detail.

**Implementation:**
- Enhance the solution display to show actual diffs
- Use a simple diff format (+ and - prefixes)
- Allow exploring changes in detail before creating PR
- Option to edit proposed changes before PR creation

**Code changes needed:**
- Create a diff display function
- Add user interaction for exploring diffs
- Update the solution display code

## 6. Toggle Between Enhanced and Normal Prompt Mode

**Current limitation:** User can choose feedback enhancement once but can't easily compare approaches.

**Implementation:**
- Add a global toggle for feedback enhancement
- Allow switching between modes easily
- Show side-by-side prompts in both modes
- Track effectiveness metrics for both approaches

**Code changes needed:**
- Add a settings toggle
- Modify the solution generation flow to respect this toggle
- Create comparison display

## 7. Simulated Repository Context

**Current limitation:** Solutions aren't based on actual repository context.

**Implementation:**
- Add the ability to "load" a simulated repository
- Use a small set of predefined files that represent a typical project
- Show how context from these files influences solutions
- Demonstrate file exploration during solution generation

**Code changes needed:**
- Create a small mock repository structure in memory
- Add repository context integration with prompts
- Show how files are referenced in solutions

## 8. Performance Metrics Display

**Current limitation:** No clear performance metrics shown.

**Implementation:**
- Add a "View Performance Metrics" option
- Track and display:
  - Token usage per request
  - Time taken for each step
  - Success rates for solutions
  - Feedback integration effectiveness

**Code changes needed:**
- Add metrics tracking throughout the flow
- Create a metrics display UI
- Add the new menu option

## 9. Templates and Patterns Library

**Current limitation:** Each solution starts from scratch.

**Implementation:**
- Add a "Manage Templates" option
- Allow saving successful solutions as templates
- Show how patterns are extracted and reused
- Demonstrate learning from past solutions

**Code changes needed:**
- Add template storage
- Create template application logic
- Add template management UI

## 10. Customizable Test Scenarios

**Current limitation:** Limited to manually created issues or GitHub issues.

**Implementation:**
- Add predefined test scenarios covering common problems
- Allow customization of test parameters
- Include edge cases to demonstrate robustness
- Show how different issues types are handled differently

**Code changes needed:**
- Create a set of test scenarios
- Add scenario selection UI
- Implement scenario parameter customization
