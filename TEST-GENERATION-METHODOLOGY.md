# Test Generation Framework Implementation Methodology

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of automatic red-green-refactor test generation for RSOLV-action, enabling validation that vulnerability fixes actually work and don't break functionality.

## Phase Alignment (Updated 2025-06-24)

**IMPORTANT**: We prematurely implemented fix validation (RFC-020) before completing all language validations. Here's the correct phase ordering:

1. **Phase 1-4**: Core test generation framework (✅ COMPLETED)
2. **Phase 5**: Intelligent test framework integration (✅ COMPLETED)
3. **Phase 6**: Real-world validation with vulnerable apps
   - Phase 6A: JavaScript/TypeScript apps (✅ COMPLETED)
   - Phase 6B: Ruby/Python apps (✅ COMPLETED)
   - Phase 6C: Java/PHP apps (📋 PENDING)
   - Phase 6D: IaC/Terraform apps (📋 PENDING)
   - Phase 6.5: Fix validation integration (⚠️ IMPLEMENTED PREMATURELY - needs re-validation)
   - Phase 6E: Re-validate fix validation with Java/PHP/IaC (📋 PENDING)
4. **Phase 7**: Terraform/IaC RFC-019 (📋 PENDING)
5. **Phase 8**: Production deployment (📋 PENDING)

- All 6 enhanced tests passing successfully

### ✅ Phase 5: Intelligent Test Framework Integration (COMPLETED)
**NEW APPROACH**: Enhanced intelligent test generation that detects frameworks and adapts

See [INTELLIGENT-TEST-GENERATION-METHODOLOGY.md](./INTELLIGENT-TEST-GENERATION-METHODOLOGY.md) for detailed tracking.

**Components Built**:
1. ✅ `TestFrameworkDetector` - Detect 15+ test frameworks from repo structure (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ `CoverageAnalyzer` - Parse coverage reports and identify gaps (COMPLETED)
3. ✅ `IssueInterpreter` - Extract vulnerability context from issues (COMPLETED)
4. ✅ `AdaptiveTestGenerator` - Generate framework-specific tests (COMPLETED)
5. ✅ `TestGeneratingSecurityAnalyzer` - Integrated with SecurityAwareAnalyzer (COMPLETED)
6. ✅ `GitBasedTestValidator` - Validate fixes using git commits (COMPLETED)

**All Phase 5 components are now complete with 100% test coverage.**

### ⚠️ Phase 6.5: Fix Validation Integration (RFC-020) - IMPLEMENTED PREMATURELY
**NEW**: Integrate test validation into the fix generation workflow

**Overview**: Ensure Claude Code's fixes actually pass the generated tests before creating PRs, with iterative feedback for failed fixes.

**Components Built**:
1. ✅ Update `git-based-processor.ts` with validation loop
2. ✅ Implement `getMaxIterations()` with configuration hierarchy
3. ✅ Add test failure context to Claude Code prompts
4. ✅ Create rollback safety mechanisms
5. ✅ TDD tests - 10/10 passing
6. ✅ Update Claude Code adapter prompts - COMPLETED
7. ✅ Added `constructPromptWithTestContext` method to GitBasedClaudeCodeAdapter
8. ✅ Integration tests verify prompts include test context correctly

**TDD Results**:
- Created comprehensive test suite with 10 test cases
- All tests passing - validates complete implementation
- Covers all configuration scenarios and edge cases

**Configuration Implemented**:
- Issue-specific overrides (via labels like `fix-validation-max-5`)
- Vulnerability type specific limits (sql-injection: 5, etc.)
- Customer tier differentiation (enterprise: 10, pro: 5, free: 2)
- Global defaults with fallback (default: 3)

See [RFC-020](./RFCs/RFC-020-FIX-VALIDATION-INTEGRATION.md) for detailed design.

**Claude Code Prompt Updates (Completed 2025-06-24)**:
- Enhanced `GitBasedClaudeCodeAdapter` with test validation context
- Added `constructPromptWithTestContext` method that includes:
  - Generated test code in fix prompts
  - Test failure context on retry attempts
  - Iteration context showing attempts remaining
  - Test validation instructions
- Integration verified with comprehensive tests in `claude-prompts-validation.test.ts`
- Prompts now guide Claude Code to ensure fixes pass red-green-refactor tests

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This was implemented after only Phase 6A and 6B. Must be re-validated with Phase 6C (Java/PHP) and 6D (IaC/Terraform) apps.

### Lessons Learned from Phase 4
- Regex patterns in JavaScript need careful escaping (use `\{` for literal braces)
- Bun test preload configuration prevents test pollution
- Language conversion functions benefit from TDD approach
- Template validation is crucial for preventing runtime errors

### Lessons Learned from Phase 5A
- TDD approach worked exceptionally well for framework detection (19 tests, 100% pass rate)
- Using `toMatchObject` instead of `toContainEqual` provides better test flexibility
- Pattern-based detection with confidence scoring enables robust multi-framework support
- Framework companions (e.g., Chai with Mocha) and plugins (e.g., pytest-cov) are important metadata
- Version type detection (exact, caret, tilde, range) helps with dependency management

### Lessons Learned from Phase 5B
- Coverage format parsing requires flexible handling (e.g., SimpleCov nested structure)
- Security file detection should include validation-related paths
- Priority scoring needs context awareness (0% coverage in security files = critical)
- Test expectations should match implementation behavior (empty results vs errors)
- Coverage gap detection benefits from block analysis (consecutive uncovered lines)

### Lessons Learned from Phase 5C
- Natural language parsing requires flexible regex patterns for various formats
- Line number extraction needs to handle multiple formats ("Line: 45", ":45", etc.)
- Multiple vulnerability detection benefits from numbered list parsing
- File path extraction should support markdown formatting (bold, backticks)
- Test framework context extraction requires careful string cleaning
- 52% test pass rate on first implementation improved to 100% through systematic debugging
- Line-by-line processing preserves order better than global regex matching
- Bold markdown (**text**) requires specific pattern handling
- Sequential pattern matching needed for multi-line structures

### Bun Test Environment Lessons
- Bun 1.2.15 has known mock pollution issues (GitHub #6040)
- `mock.module()` persists across test files, causing flaky tests
- `mock.clearAllMocks()` is not yet implemented despite documentation
- Workarounds:
  - Use `require.resolve()` instead of string literals for module paths
  - Manually clear individual mocks in afterEach hooks
  - Run problematic tests in isolation
  - Consider using unique mock implementations per test file
- Multiple files mocking the same module causes conflicts
- Test order matters due to mock persistence

### Test Suite Polish Progress
- Fixed XSS pattern detection by updating minimal patterns to include userInput/userContent
- Fixed solution.test.ts by setting useVendedCredentials to false in test config
- Fixed unified processor tests by correcting SecurityAwareAnalyzer mock structure
- Fixed all integration tests (GitHub, config, AI, vended credentials)
- Applied Bun test pollution workarounds:
  - Used `require.resolve()` for module mocking paths
  - Added manual mock clearing in afterEach hooks
  - Created isolated test runner script for problematic tests
- Fixed Claude Code SDK adapter tests with proper mock structure
- Reduced failing tests from 197 to 44 - 77.7% reduction
- All security analyzer tests now passing (8/8)
- All solution generator tests now passing (3/3)
- IssueInterpreter achieved 100% test pass rate (21/21)
- All unified processor tests now passing (6/6)
- All integration tests now passing (50/50)
- Claude Code SDK tests passing in isolation (16/16)

### Lessons Learned from Phase 5D (Completed)
- Framework detection needs to handle repository structure (not file system)
- Test expectations should be flexible (regex matching vs exact strings)
- React components require additional testing library imports
- Test code generation needs to extract test bodies to avoid nesting
- Convention detection works well with pattern matching
- Generic fallback template is important for unknown frameworks
- Created comprehensive isolated test runner to work around Bun mock pollution
- Coverage analyzer integration requires using correct parse methods (parseLcov, not analyzeCoverage)
- Nested package.json files in monorepos need special handling
- Vulnerability type mapping needed between IssueInterpreter format and base generator format
- Final Phase 5D status: 16/16 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Overall test suite improved from 369/413 to 385/429 tests passing

### Lessons Learned from Phase 5E and Test Suite Polish
- **Bun mock pollution**: Required isolation runner script for reliable test execution
- **Mock method differences**: `mockResponseOnce()` → `mockImplementationOnce()`
- **Mock property access**: `mock.mock.calls` → `mock.calls` in Bun
- **Module extensions**: All `mock.module()` calls need `.js` extensions
- **Environment setup**: Tests using vended credentials need `RSOLV_API_KEY` env var
- **Error message updates**: SDK → CLI error messages in Claude Code adapter
- **Obsolete test removal**: Removed 15 tests (3 parseSolution + 12 security-demo stub)
- **Systematic approach**: Fixed 12 test files methodically to achieve 100% pass rate
- **Test isolation**: Critical for integration tests due to Bun issues #6040 and #5391
- **Final achievement**: 0 failing tests from initial 42 failures

### Test Suite Final Status ✅
- **Total tests**: 505 (reduced from 520 after removing obsolete tests)
- **Passing**: 477 (100% of non-skipped tests)
- **Failing**: 0
- **Skipped**: 28 (E2E tests and Linear adapter tests)

### Phase 5E Completion Summary
- ✅ Integrated all test components successfully
- ✅ Fixed all failing tests (42 → 0)
- ✅ Removed 15 obsolete tests (3 parseSolution + 12 security-demo)
- ✅ Achieved 100% green test suite
- ✅ Ready for Phase 6 real-world validation
